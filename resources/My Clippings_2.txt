Once poor people are persuaded that their poverty is their own fault, that whoever has made a lot of money must deserve it and that they too could become rich if they tried hard enough, life becomes easier for the rich. The poor, often against their own interests, begin to demand fewer redistributive taxes, less welfare spending, less regulation on business and fewer worker rights.

Self-seeking itself is too simplistically defined, with the implicit assumption that individuals are incapable of recognizing long-term, systemic consequences of their actions. Some European capitalists in the nineteenth century argued for a ban on child labour, despite the fact that such regulation would reduce their profits. They understood that continued exploitation of children without education would lower the quality of the workforce, harming all capitalists, including themselves, in the long run. In other words, people can, and do, pursue enlightened self-interest.

Individualist economic theories assume individuals to be rational – that is, they know all possible states of the world in the future, make complicated calculations about the likelihood of each of these states and exactly know their preferences over them, thereby choosing the best possible course of action on each and every decision occasion. Once again, the implication is that we should let people be, because ‘they know what they are doing’.

Our decisions are heavily affected by the ‘framing’ of the question when they shouldn’t, in the sense that we may make different decisions about essentially the same problem, depending on the way it is presented. And we tend to over-react to new information and under-react to existing information; this is frequently observed in the financial market.

Emphasizing the importance of ‘real’ choices is not to suggest that we can make any choice we like. Self-help books may tell you that you can do or become anything if you choose to. But the options that people can choose from (or their choice sets) are usually severely limited. This could be because of the meagreness of the resources they command; as Karl Marx dramatically put it,

The economists’ favoured measure for output is Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. It is, roughly speaking, the total monetary value of what has been produced within a country over a particular period of time – usually a year, but also a quarter (three months) or even a month.

In calculating GDP, we measure output – or product – by value added. Value added is the value of a producer’s output minus the intermediate inputs it has used. A bakery may earn £150,000 a year by selling bread and pastries, but if it has paid £100,000 in order to buy various intermediate inputs – raw materials (e.g., flour, butter, eggs, sugar), fuel, electricity and so on – it has only added £50,000 of value to those inputs.

In this case, that something is the used-up parts of capital goods – basically machines, so we are talking the baker’s ovens, dough mixers and bread slicers. Capital goods, or machines, are not ‘consumed’ and incorporated into the output in the same way in which flour is to bread, but they experience reduction in economic value with use – this is known as depreciation. If we take away the wear and tear of machines from GDP, we get Net Domestic Product, or NDP.

A critical limitation of GDP and GNP measures is that they value outputs at market prices. Since a lot of economic activities occur outside the market, the values of their outputs need to be somehow calculated – ‘imputed’ is the technical word.

Worse, there is a particular class of non-marketed output whose value isn’t even imputed. Household work – including cooking, cleaning, care work for children and elderly relatives and so on – is simply not counted as part of GDP or GNP. The classic ‘joke’ among economists is that you reduce your national output if you marry your housekeeper.

The sum of these incomes is known as Gross Domestic Income, or GDI. In theory, GDI should be identical to GDP, as it is simply a different way of adding up the same thing. But in practice it is slightly different, as some of the data used in compiling the two of them may be collected through different channels.

To deal with this problem, economists have come up with the idea of an ‘international dollar’. Based on the notion of purchasing power parity (PPP) – that is, measuring the value of a currency according to how much of a common set of goods and services (known as the ‘consumption basket’) it can buy in different countries – this fictitious currency allows us to convert incomes of different countries into a common measure of living standards.

Many people question whether happiness can be, and indeed should be, measured at all. The fact that happiness may be conceptually a better measure than income does not mean that we should try to measure it. Richard Layard, the British economist who is a leading scholar trying to measure happiness, defends such attempts by saying, ‘If you think something matters you should try to measure it [italics added].’3 But other people disagree – including Albert Einstein, who once famously said, ‘Not everything that counts can be measured. Not everything that can be measured counts.’

The issue of false consciousness is a genuinely difficult problem that has no definite solution. We should not approve of an unequal and brutal society because surveys show that people are happy. But who has the right to tell those oppressed women or starving landless peasants that they shouldn’t be happy, if they think they are? Does anyone have the right to make those people feel miserable by telling them the ‘truth’? There are no easy answers to these questions, but they definitely tell us that we cannot rely on ‘subjective’ happiness surveys to decide how well people are doing.

Concluding Remarks: Why Numbers in Economics Can Never Be Objective Defining and measuring concepts in economics cannot be objective in the way such exercises in physics or chemistry can be. Even such an exercise regarding what are seemingly the most straightforward of economic concepts, such as output and income, is fraught with difficulties.

The difference in size is one reason – it is possible to ignore very small countries, even if they are doing very well. But most people do not take Equatorial Guinea’s phenomenal income growth seriously mainly because it is due to a resource bonanza. Nothing about the country’s economy changed other than finding a very large oil reserve in 1996. Without oil, the country would be reduced to one of the poorest in the world once again, which it used to be, as it cannot produce much else.

In the early nineteenth century, factory productivity was further raised by lining up the workers in accordance with the order of their tasks within the production process. The assembly line was born. In the late nineteenth century, the assembly line was put on a conveyor belt. The moving assembly line made it possible for capitalists to increase the pace of work simply by turning up the speed of the conveyor belt.

The most important in this regard was Taylorism, named after Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856–1915), the American engineer and later management guru. Taylor argued that the production process should be divided up into the simplest possible tasks and that workers should be taught the most effective ways to perform them, established through scientific analyses of the work process. It is also known as scientific management for this reason.

Combining the moving assembly line with the Taylorist principle, the mass production system was born in the early years of the twentieth century. It is often called Fordism because it was first perfected – but not ‘invented’, as the folklore goes – by Henry Ford in his Model-T car factory in 1908. The idea is that production costs can be cut by producing a large volume of standardized products, using standardized parts, dedicated machinery and a moving assembly line. This would also make workers more easily replaceable and thus easier to control, because, performing standardized tasks, they need to have relatively few skills.

The system, most famously practised by Toyota, has its parts delivered ‘just in time’ for the production, eliminating inventory costs. By working with the suppliers to raise the quality of the parts they deliver (the so-called ‘zero defect movement’), it vastly reduces the need for rework and fine-tuning at the end of the assembly line which had plagued Fordist factories. It also uses machines that allow quick change-overs between different models (e.g., by allowing a quick exchange of dies) and thus can offer a much greater variety of products than the Fordist system does.

In order to be used, most technologies have to be embodied in fixed capital, namely, machines and structures (e.g., buildings, railways). So, without high investment in fixed capital, technically known as gross fixed capital formation (GFCF),* an economy cannot develop its productive potential very much. Thus, the investment ratio (GFCF/GDP) is a good indicator of its development potential. Indeed, the positive relationship between a country’s investment ratio and its rate of economic growth is one of the few undisputed relationships in economics.

The manufacturing sector has been the ‘learning centre’ of capitalism. By supplying capital goods (e.g., machines, transport equipment), it has spread higher productive capabilities to other sectors of the economy, whether they are other manufacturing activities producing consumer goods (e.g., washing machines, breakfast cereals), agriculture or services.

The share of manufacturing both in output and in employment was almost constantly rising in most countries. However, from the 1960s, some countries started experiencing deindustrialization – a fall in the share of manufacturing, and a corresponding rise in the share of services, in both output and employment.

This prompted the talk of a post-industrial society. Many economists have argued that, with rising income, we begin to demand services, such as eating out and foreign holidays, relatively more than we demand manufactured goods. The resulting fall in the relative demand for manufacturing leads to a shrinking role for manufacturing, reflected in lower output and employment shares.

Most rich countries have indeed become ‘post-industrial’ or ‘deindustrialized’ in terms of employment; a decreasing proportion of the labour force in these countries is working in factories, as opposed to shops and offices. In most, although not all, countries this has been accompanied by a fall in the share of manufacturing in output. But this does not necessarily mean that those countries are producing fewer manufactured goods in absolute terms. Much of this apparent fall is due to the decline in the prices of manufactured goods, compared to the prices of services.

The view that the world has now entered a new era of the ‘knowledge economy’, in which making things does not confer much value, is based upon a fundamental misreading of history. We have always lived in a knowledge economy. It has always been the quality of knowledge involved, rather than the physical nature of the things produced (that is, whether they are physical goods or intangible services), that has made the more industrialized countries richer.

Today, agriculture plays a very small role, in terms of both output and employment, in the rich countries. Only 1–2 per cent of their GDP is produced in agriculture, while only 2–3 per cent of people work there. This has been possible because agricultural productivity in those countries has risen enormously in the last century or so.

Financial liberalization has allowed banks to redirect their loans to (more lucrative) consumers, away from producers. Policies geared towards inflation control, such as high interest rates and over-valued currencies, have added to the agony of manufacturing firms by making loans expensive and exports more difficult.

Production has been seriously neglected in the mainstream of economics, which is dominated by the Neoclassical school. For most economists, economics ends at the factory gate (or increasingly the entrance of an office block), so to speak. The production process is treated as a predictable process, pre-determined by a ‘production function’, clearly specifying the amounts of capital and labour that need to be combined in order to produce a particular product.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, development of productive capabilities, especially in the manufacturing sector, is crucial if we are to deal with the greatest challenge of our time – climate change. In addition to changing their consumption patterns, the rich countries need to further develop their productive capabilities in the area of green technologies. Even just to cope with the adverse consequences of climate change, developing countries need to further develop technological and organizational capabilities, many of which can only be acquired through industrialization.

However, this ‘trick’ works only insofar as the confidence problem is one of cash flows – or what is called a liquidity crisis. In this situation, the bank in trouble owns assets (loans that it has made, bonds and other financial assets it has bought, etc.) whose values are greater than its liabilities (deposits, bonds it has issued, loans from another bank, etc.) but it cannot immediately sell those assets and meet all liabilities that are due.

If the bank has a solvency crisis, which means that the total value of its liabilities exceeds that of its assets, no amount of central bank lending will fix the problem. Either the bank will go bankrupt or require a government bail-out, which happens when the government injects new capital into the troubled bank (as happened with Northern Rock and Icesave). Government bail-out of banks has become highly visible after the 2008 crisis, but it is a practice that has been going on throughout the history of capitalism.

Another way to manage confidence in the banking system is to restrict the ability of the banks to take risk. This is known as prudential regulation. One important measure of prudential regulation is the ‘capital adequacy ratio’. This limits the amount that a bank can lend (and thus the liabilities it can create in the form of deposits) to a certain multiple of its equity capital (that is, the money provided by the bank’s owners, or shareholders). Such regulation is also known as ‘leverage regulation’, as it is a regulation on how much you can ‘leverage’ your original capital. Another typical measure of prudential regulation is ‘liquidity regulation’, that is, to demand that each bank holds more than a certain proportion of its assets in cash or other highly ‘liquid’ assets (assets that can be quickly sold for cash, such as government bonds).

Within this broad framework, there were important international variations. In the US and the UK, these (stock and bond) ‘markets’ were bigger (in relative terms) and more influential than in countries like Germany, Japan or France, where banks played a much more important role. For this reason, the former countries were known to have ‘market-based’ financial systems and the latter ‘bank-based’ ones. The former system is said to generate greater pressure for short-term profits on the part of enterprises than the latter, as shareholders (and bondholders) have less commitment to the companies they ‘own’ than banks do to the companies they lend to.

since ABSs have become ‘structured’ and been turned into Collateralized Debt Obligations (or CDOs). Structuring in this context involves combining a number of ABSs, such as RMBSs, into yet another composite bond, such as CDO, and dividing the new bond into a few tranches (slices) with differential risks. The most ‘senior’ tranche would be made safer by, say, the guarantee that its owners will be asked to bear losses the last (that is, only after the owners of all other, more ‘junior’, tranches have absorbed their losses), should any loss occur. In this way, a very safe financial product could be created out of a pool of relatively unsafe assets – that was at least the theory.

In other words, someone who has no inherent interest in the price of oil itself, whether as a consumer or as an oil refinery, can make a bet on the movements of oil prices. Thus, in a provocative but insightful analogy, Brett Scott, a financial activist, points out that ‘[saying] that derivatives exist to allow people to hedge themselves … [is] a bit like arguing that the horse betting industry exists to help horse owners protect themselves from risk [of their horses losing a race].’

An option contract would give a contracting party the right (but not the obligation) to buy (or sell) something at a price fixed now at some particular date. The option to buy is called a ‘call’ option, and the option to sell is called a ‘put’ option. Options have become more widely known through ‘stock options’ – that is, the right to buy a certain number of stocks (shares) at a pre-agreed price at some future date – given to top managers (and sometimes other employees), to encourage them to manage companies in a way that raises share prices.

Where a forward is like a bet on a single future event, a swap is like a bet on a series of future events; it is like a number of forward contracts linked together. For example, it allows you to replace a series of variable future payments or earnings with a series of fixed payments or earnings, like contracts for your mobile phone or fixed-price electricity deals over a period, according to Scott’s instructive analogy.

Then a historic change came in 1982. In that year, two key US financial regulatory bodies, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) agreed that the settlement of a derivative contract does not have to involve the delivery of the underlying goods (e.g., rice or oil) but can be settled in cash.

What made things worse was that the low degrees of income inequality were often seen as charades. Low income inequality in these countries co-existed with high inequality in other dimensions (e.g., access to higher-quality foreign goods, opportunities to travel abroad), based upon ideological conformity or even personal networks.

Simon Kuznets, the Russian-born American economist, who won one of the first Nobel Prizes in Economics (in 1971 – the first one was in 1969), proposed a famous theory about inequality over time. The so-called Kuznets hypothesis is that, as a country develops economically, inequality first increases and then decreases.

According to Kuznets, in the earliest stage of economic development income distribution remains quite equal. It is because most people are poor farmers at that stage. As the country industrializes and grows, more and more people move out of agriculture and into industry, where wages are higher. This increases inequality. As the economy develops even further, Kuznets argued, inequality begins to decrease. Most people now work in the industrial sector or in the urban service sector that serves the industrial sector, while few remain in the agricultural sector with low wages. The result is the famous inverted-U-shaped curve, known as the Kuznets curve,

Indeed, Kuznets himself did not believe that the decrease in inequality in the later stage of economic development would be automatic. While believing that the nature of modern economic development made the inverted-U curve likely, he emphasized that the actual degree of the decrease in inequality would be strongly affected by the strengths of trade unions and, in particular, of the welfare state.

In theory, the Gini coefficient can be anything between 0 and 1. In practice, these extreme values are impossible. No society, however egalitarian it may be in spirit and policies, can make everyone exactly equal, which is what is needed for a Gini coefficient of 0. In a society with a Gini of 1, everyone except one person who has everything will soon be dead.* In real life, no country has a Gini coefficient below 0.2 and none has one above 0.75.

In developing countries, many people are in disguised unemployment in the sense that they have a job that adds very little, if anything at all, to output and mainly acts as a way to get some income. Examples include rural people working on an overcrowded family farm and those poor people in the informal sector (the collection of unregistered small – often one-person – businesses) ‘inventing’ jobs so that they can beg without appearing to beg (more on these later). These people ‘cannot afford to be unemployed’, as the saying goes.

Another explanation for the faulty stereotypes is that people often mistakenly believe that poverty is the result of laziness and thus automatically assume that people in poorer countries are lazier.7 But what makes those people poor is their low productivity, which is rarely their own fault.

The trouble is that this process is not instantaneous. It takes time for people to search for new jobs and for companies to find the right people. The result is that some people end up spending some time unemployed in the process. This is known as frictional unemployment.

The main solution to cyclical unemployment is to boost demand through government deficit spending and loose monetary policy (such as the lowering of interest rates) until the private sector recovers and starts creating enough new jobs.

While the Keynesians see unemployment as a cyclical thing, many economists – from Karl Marx to Joseph Stiglitz (in his ‘efficiency wage’ model) – have argued that unemployment is something that is inherent to capitalism.

In order to be classified as unemployed, the person should have been ‘actively seeking work’, which is defined as having applied for paid jobs in the recent past – usually in the preceding four weeks. When you subtract those who are not actively seeking work from your working-age population, you get the economically active population. Only those who are economically active (that is, actively seeking paid jobs) but are not working are counted as unemployed.

Work is seen as an inconvenience that we have to endure in order to get income, and we are seen as being purely driven by our desire to consume with that income. Especially in the rich countries, such consumerist mentality has led to waste, shopping addiction and unsustainable household debts, while making it more difficult to reduce carbon emission and fight climate change.

In its purest form, this philosophical stance leads to the view that the government is a product of a social contract between sovereign individuals and thus cannot be above individuals. In this view, known as contractarianism, a state action can be justified only when every individual gives his/her consent.

In his famous 1651 book, Leviathan, named after the biblical sea monster, Hobbes starts by presuming a ‘state of nature’, in which free individuals existed without a government. In that world, Hobbes argued, individuals were engaged in what he called the ‘war of all against all’, and as a result their lives were ‘solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short’. In order to overcome this state of affairs, individuals voluntarily agreed to accept certain restrictions on their freedom imposed by a government so that they could have social peace.

In this pro-free-market version of contractarianism, more commonly known as libertarianism in the US, Leviathan came to depict the state as a potential monster that needs to be restrained (which is not what Hobbes intended). This view is best summed up in Ronald Reagan’s comment that ‘Government exists to protect us from each other. Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves.’

However, there are some goods whose use by non-payers cannot be prevented, once they are supplied. Such goods (and services) are known as public goods. The existence of public goods is arguably the most frequently cited type of market failure, even more than externality, the original market failure.

In other words, if you can free-ride on other people to pay for a public good, you don’t have the incentive to voluntarily pay for it. But if everyone thinks the same way, no one will pay for it, which means that the good is not going to be provided at all. At most, it may be provided in sub-optimal quantities by large consumers who would rather let some people free-ride on them than not have the good at all.

It is therefore widely accepted that public goods can be supplied in optimal quantities only if the government taxes all potential users (which often means all citizens and residents) and uses the proceeds either to provide them itself or to pay some supplier to provide them.

However, according to Neoclassical economics, it is not the transfer of extra profit from consumers to the firms with market power that is considered to be a market failure. The failure is due to the social loss that even the firms with market power cannot appropriate – known as allocative deadweight loss.

The case of natural monopoly – which is found in industries like electricity, water, gas and railways – poses a unique challenge. In these industries, having multiple suppliers each with their own networks of, say, water pipes or railways, increases the production cost so much that monopoly is the most cost-efficient arrangement. In such a case, the government may set up an SOE and run it as if it is not a monopoly.

Markets run according to the ‘one-dollar-one-vote’ rule, while democratic politics run on the principle of ‘one-person-one-vote’.

Free-market economists, more specifically the proponents of the government failure argument, have persuaded the rest of the world, including many politicians and bureaucrats themselves, that we cannot trust those who run the government to act in public interests. Therefore, they have told us, the less a government does, the better it is. Even in areas where the government is a ‘necessary evil’, it should be constrained by rigid rules that politicians cannot mess around with.

It must reflect two truths: order without freedom, even if sustained by momentary exaltation, eventually creates its own counterpoise; yet freedom cannot be secured or sustained without a framework of order to keep the peace. Order and freedom, sometimes described as opposite poles on the spectrum of experience, should instead be understood as interdependent.

Europe thrived on fragmentation and embraced its own divisions.

Aspirations to unity were briefly realized on Christmas Day 800, when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne, the Frankish King and conqueror of much of present-day France and Germany, as Imperator Romanorum (Emperor of the Romans), and awarded him theoretical title to the former eastern half of the erstwhile Roman Empire, at that point the lands of Byzantium.

China had its Emperor; Islam had its Caliph—the recognized leader of the lands of Islam. Europe had the Holy Roman Emperor. But the Holy Roman Emperor operated from a much weaker base than his confreres in other civilizations. He had no imperial bureaucracy at his disposal.

Yet following the head navigator Zheng He’s death in 1433, the Chinese Emperor put an end to overseas adventures, and the fleet was abandoned.

The third revolutionary upheaval, that of the Protestant Reformation, was initiated when Martin Luther posted ninety-five theses on the door of the Wittenberg Castle Church in 1517, insisting on the individual’s direct relationship with God; hence individual conscience—not established orthodoxy—was put forward as the key to salvation. A number of feudal rulers seized the opportunity to enhance their authority by embracing Protestantism, imposing it on their populations, and enriching themselves by seizing Church lands. Each side regarded the other as heretical, and disagreements turned into life-or-death struggles as political and sectarian disputes commingled.

The period labeled by posterity as the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48) brought this turmoil to a climax. With an imperial succession looming and the Catholic King of Bohemia, the Habsburg Ferdinand, emerging as the most plausible candidate, the Protestant Bohemian nobility attempted an act of “regime change,” offering their crown—and its decisive electoral vote—to a Protestant German prince, an outcome in which the Holy Roman Empire would have ceased to be a Catholic institution. Imperial forces moved to crush the Bohemian rebellion and then pressed their advantage against Protestantism generally, triggering a war that devastated Central Europe.

Richelieu developed a radical approach to international order. He invented the idea that the state was an abstract and permanent entity existing in its own right. Its requirements were not determined by the ruler’s personality, family interests, or the universal demands of religion. Its lodestar was the national interest following calculable principles—what later came to be known as raison d’état. Hence it should be the basic unit of international relations.

Richelieu’s design would endure through vast upheavals. For two and a half centuries—from the emergence of Richelieu in 1624 to Bismarck’s proclamation of the German Empire in 1871—the aim of keeping Central Europe (more or less the territory of contemporary Germany, Austria, and northern Italy) divided remained the guiding principle of French foreign policy. For as long as this concept served as the essence of the European order, France was preeminent on the Continent. When it collapsed, so did France’s dominant role.

The Peace of Westphalia that emerged from these convoluted discussions is probably the most frequently cited diplomatic document in European history, though in fact no single treaty exists to embody its terms. Nor did the delegates ever meet in a single plenary session to adopt it. The peace is in reality the sum of three separate complementary agreements signed at different times in different cities. In the January 1648 Peace of Münster, Spain recognized the independence of the Dutch Republic, capping an eight-decades-long Dutch revolt that had merged with the Thirty Years’ War. In October 1648, separate groupings of powers signed the Treaty of Münster and the Treaty of Osnabrück, with terms mirroring each other and incorporating key provisions by reference.

The Peace of Westphalia became a turning point in the history of nations because the elements it set in place were as uncomplicated as they were sweeping. The state, not the empire, dynasty, or religious confession, was affirmed as the building block of European order. The concept of state sovereignty was established. The right of each signatory to choose its own domestic structure and religious orientation free from intervention was affirmed, while novel clauses ensured that minority sects could practice their faith in peace and be free from the prospect of forced conversion. Beyond the immediate demands of the moment, the principles of a system of “international relations” were taking shape, motivated by the common desire to avoid a recurrence of total war on the Continent.

Armies had marched across Europe for generations under the banner of universal (and contradictory) moral claims; prophets and conquerors had unleashed total war in pursuit of a mixture of personal, dynastic, imperial, and religious ambitions. The theoretically logical and predictable intermeshing of state interests was intended to overcome the disorder unfolding in every corner of the Continent. Limited wars over calculable issues would replace the era of contending universalisms, with its forced expulsions and conversions and general war consuming civilian populations.

For the rest, Fortune can dispose as she likes: his life is now secure. Nothing can be taken from this life, and you can only add to it as if giving to a man who is already full and satisfied food which he does not want but can hold. So you must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long. For suppose you should think that a man had had a long voyage who had been caught in a raging storm as he left harbour, and carried hither and thither and driven round and round in a circle by the rage of opposing winds? He did not have a long voyage, just a long tossing about.

They are trifling with life’s most precious commodity, being deceived because it is an intangible thing, not open to inspection and therefore reckoned very cheap – in fact, almost without any value. People are delighted to accept pensions and gratuities, for which they hire out their labour or their support or their services. But nobody works out the value of time: men use it lavishly as if it cost nothing. But if death threatens these same people, you will see them praying to their doctors; if they are in fear of capital punishment, you will see them prepared to spend their all to stay alive. So inconsistent are they in their feelings.

We are in the habit of saying that it was not in our power to choose the parents who were allotted to us, that they were given to us by chance. But we can choose whose children we would like to be. There are households of the noblest intellects: choose the one into which you wish to be adopted, and you will inherit not only their name but their property too. Nor will this property need to be guarded meanly or grudgingly: the more it is shared out, the greater it will become. These will offer you a path to immortality and raise you to a point from which no one is cast down. This is the only way to prolong mortality – even to convert it to immortality.

So, when you see a man repeatedly wearing the robe of office, or one whose name is often spoken in the Forum, do not envy him: these things are won at the cost of life. In order that one year may be dated from their names they will waste all their own years. Life has left some men struggling at the start of their careers before they could force their way to the height of their ambition. Some men, after they have crawled through a thousand indignities to the supreme dignity, have been assailed by the gloomy thought that all their labours were but for the sake of an epitaph. Some try to adjust their extreme old age to new hopes as though it were youth, but find its weakness fails them in the midst of efforts that overtax it.

In his Leviathan, published in 1651, three years after the Peace of Westphalia, Thomas Hobbes provided such a theory. He imagined a “state of nature” in the past when the absence of authority produced a “war of all against all.” To escape such intolerable insecurity, he theorized, people delivered their rights to a sovereign power in return for the sovereign’s provision of security for all within the state’s borders. The sovereign state’s monopoly on power was established as the only way to overcome the perpetual fear of violent death and war.

So long as England assessed its strategic requirements correctly, it would be able to back the weaker side on the Continent against the stronger, preventing any single country from achieving hegemony in Europe and thereby mobilizing the resources of the Continent to challenge Britain’s control of the seas. Until the outbreak of World War I, England acted as the balancer of the equilibrium. It fought in European wars but with shifting alliances—not in pursuit of specific, purely national goals, but by identifying the national interest with the preservation of the balance of power. Many of these principles apply to America’s role in the contemporary world,

There were in fact two balances of power being conducted in Europe after the Westphalian settlement: The overall balance, of which England acted as a guardian, was the protector of general stability. A Central European balance essentially manipulated by France aimed to prevent the emergence of a unified Germany in a position to become the most powerful country on the Continent.

The balance of power can be challenged in at least two ways: The first is if a major country augments its strength to a point where it threatens to achieve hegemony. The second occurs when a heretofore-secondary state seeks to enter the ranks of the major powers and sets off a series of compensating adjustments by the other powers until a new equilibrium is established or a general conflagration takes place.

The Holy Roman Empire had become a facade; no rival European claimant to universal authority had arisen. Almost all rulers asserted that they ruled by divine right—a claim not challenged by any major power—but they accepted that God had similarly endowed many other monarchs. Wars were therefore fought for limited territorial objectives, not to overthrow existing governments and institutions, nor to impose a new system of relations between states.

The answer, Kant held, was a voluntary federation of republics pledged to non-hostility and transparent domestic and international conduct. Their citizens would cultivate peace because, unlike despotic rulers, when considering hostilities, they would be deliberating about “calling down on themselves all the miseries of war.” Over time the attractions of this compact would become apparent, opening the way toward its gradual expansion into a peaceful world order. It was Nature’s purpose that humanity eventually reason its way toward “a system of united power, hence a cosmopolitan system of general political security” and “a perfect civil union of mankind.”

This “land of the Rus” stood at the fraught intersections of civilizations and trade routes. With Vikings to its north, the expanding Arab empire to its south, and raiding Turkic tribes to its east, Russia was permanently in the grip of conflating temptations and fears. Too far to the east to have experienced the Roman Empire (though “czars” claimed the “Caesars” as their political and etymological forebears), Christian but looking to the Orthodox Church in Constantinople rather than Rome for spiritual authority, Russia was close enough to Europe to share a common cultural vocabulary yet perpetually out of phase with the Continent’s historical trends.

In this context, a distinctive Russian concept of political legitimacy took hold.

One of these is having the smallest possible set of functionalities, while leaving the rest to the so-called userland (or userspace), which is the ecosystem of modules living outside the core.

Node.js uses the concept of a module as the fundamental means for structuring the code of a program. It is the building block for creating applications and reusable libraries. In Node.js, one of the most evangelized principles is designing small modules (and packages), not only in terms of raw code size, but, most importantly, in terms of scope.

Designing simple, as opposed to perfect, fully featured software is a good practice for several reasons: it takes less effort to implement, it allows shipping faster with fewer resources, it's easier to adapt, and, finally, it's easier to maintain and understand. The positive effects of these factors encourage community contributions and allow the software itself to grow and improve.

I/O is slow I/O (short for input/output) is definitely the slowest among the fundamental operations of a computer. Accessing the RAM is in the order of nanoseconds (10E-9 seconds), while accessing data on the disk or the network is in the order of milliseconds (10E-3 seconds).

for example, while interacting with databases or with the filesystem—we will soon realize how many times a thread has to block in order to wait for the result of an I/O operation. Unfortunately, a thread is not cheap in terms of system resources—it consumes memory and causes context switches—so having a long-running thread for each connection and not using it for most of the time means wasting precious memory and CPU cycles.

For example, in Unix operating systems, the fcntl() function is used to manipulate an existing file descriptor (which in Unix represents the reference used to access a local file or a network socket) to change its operating mode to non-blocking (with the O_NONBLOCK flag). Once the resource is in non-blocking mode, any read operation will fail with the return code EAGAIN if the resource doesn't have any data ready to be read.

The most basic pattern for dealing with this type of non-blocking I/O is to actively poll the resource within a loop until some actual data is returned. This is called busy-waiting.

most modern operating systems provide a native mechanism to handle concurrent non-blocking resources in an efficient way. We are talking about the synchronous event demultiplexer (also known as the event notification interface).

Demultiplexing refers to the opposite operation, whereby the signal is split again into its original components. Both terms are used in other areas (for example, video processing) to describe the general operation of combining different things into one and vice versa. The synchronous event demultiplexer that we were talking about watches multiple resources and returns a new event (or set of events) when a read or write operation executed over one of those resources completes. The advantage here is that the synchronous event demultiplexer is, of course, synchronous, so it blocks until there are new events to process. The following is the pseudocode of an algorithm that uses a generic synchronous event demultiplexer to read

The main idea behind the reactor pattern is to have a handler associated with each I/O operation. A handler in Node.js is represented by a callback (or cb for short) function. The handler will be invoked as soon as an event is produced and processed by the event loop. The structure of the reactor pattern is shown in Figure 1.3: Figure

But this is not the only reason for choosing this I/O model. In fact, having a single thread also has a beneficial impact on the way programmers approach concurrency in general. Throughout the book, you will see how the absence of in-process race conditions and multiple threads to synchronize allows us to use much simpler concurrency strategies.

This is what happens in an application using the reactor pattern: The application generates a new I/O operation by submitting a request to the Event Demultiplexer. The application also specifies a handler, which will be invoked when the operation completes. Submitting a new request to the Event Demultiplexer is a non-blocking call and it immediately returns control to the application. When a set of I/O operations completes, the Event Demultiplexer pushes a set of corresponding events into the Event Queue. At this point, the Event Loop iterates over the items of the Event Queue. For each event, the associated handler is invoked. The handler, which is part of the application code, gives back control to the Event Loop when its execution completes (5a). While the handler executes, it can request new asynchronous operations (5b), causing new items to be added to the Event Demultiplexer (1). When all the items in the Event Queue are processed, the Event Loop blocks again on the Event Demultiplexer, which then triggers another cycle when a new event is available.

This is exactly why the Node.js core team created a native library called libuv, with the objective to make Node.js compatible with all the major operating systems and normalize the non-blocking behavior of the different types of resource. Libuv represents the low-level I/O engine of Node.js and is probably the most important component that Node.js is built on.

The browser provides a higher-level abstraction over the operating system resources, which makes it easier to control and contain the code that runs in it, which will also inevitably limit its capabilities. In turn, in Node.js we can virtually have access to all the services exposed by the operating system.

But time is the most unforgiving of fires, and she couldn’t, in the end, save it all. Still, she had these: that first, tremendous pang of pain down below. The slant of sunlight on the rug. Her heel grazing the cold hardness of his leg, lying beside them, hastily unstrapped. Her hands cupping his elbows. The upside-down, mandolin-shaped birthmark beneath his collarbone, glowing red. His face hovering over hers. His black curls dangling, tickling her lips, her chin. The terror that they would be discovered. The disbelief at their own boldness, their courage. The strange and indescribable pleasure, interlaced with the pain. And the look, the myriad of looks, on Tariq: of apprehension, tenderness, apology, embarrassment, but mostly, mostly, of hunger.

Seasons had come and gone; presidents in Kabul had been inaugurated and murdered; an empire had been defeated; old wars had ended and new ones had broken out. But Mariam had hardly noticed, hardly cared. She had passed these years in a distant corner of her mind. A dry, barren field, out beyond wish and lament, beyond dream and disillusionment. There, the future did not matter. And the past held only this wisdom: that love was a damaging mistake, and its accomplice, hope, a treacherous illusion. And whenever those twin poisonous flowers began to sprout in the parched land of that field, Mariam uprooted them. She uprooted them and ditched them before they took hold. But somehow, over these last months, Laila and Aziza—a harami like herself, as it turned out—had become extensions of her, and now, without them, the life Mariam had tolerated for so long suddenly seemed intolerable. We’re leaving this spring, Aziza and I. Come with us, Mariam.

Few beyond the intelligence service had heard of Zarqawi when Washington made him a terrorist superstar, declaring to the world in 2003 that this obscure Jordanian was the link between Iraq’s dictatorship and the plotters behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The claim was wrong, yet, weeks later, when U.S. troops invaded Iraq, the newly famous and well-funded terrorist gained a battleground and a cause and soon thousands of followers.

Osama bin Laden had sought to liberate Muslim nations gradually from corrupting Western influences so they could someday unify as a single Islamic theocracy, or caliphate. Zarqawi, by contrast, insisted that he would create his caliphate immediately—right now. He would seek to usher in God’s kingdom on Earth through acts of unthinkable savagery, believing, correctly, that theatrical displays of extreme violence would attract the most hardened jihadists to his cause and frighten everyone else into submission. His strategy shook the region as al-Qaeda never had.

In the prophetic passages of the Muslim holy texts known as the Hadith, Zarqawi saw his fate foretold. He and his men were the black-clad soldiers of whom the ancient scholars had written: “The black flags will come from the East, led by mighty men, with long hair and beards, their surnames taken from their home towns.” These conquerors would not merely reclaim the ancient Muslim lands. They also would be the instigators of the final cataclysmic struggle ending in the destruction of the West’s great armies, in northern Syria.

Christianity would be powerless to block this trend because it exists only in the realm of the spirit—“like a vision in a pure ideal world.” Islam, on the other hand, is “a complete system” with laws, social codes, economic rules, and its own method of government.

Most Saudis reject the name Wahhabi; they either call themselves muwahhidun—unitarians—since the essence of their belief is the oneness of God, or Salafists, which refers to their predecessors (salaf), the venerated companions of the Prophet. The founder of the movement, Mohammed ibn Abdul Wahhab, was an eighteenth-century revivalist who believed that Muslims had drifted away from the true religion as it had been expressed during the Golden Age of the Prophet and his immediate successors. Among other theological innovations, Abdul Wahhab believed that God clothed Himself in a human form; he rejected the intercessory prayer of saints and expressions of reverence for the dead; and he demanded that Muslim men refuse to trim their beards.

Radicalism usually prospers in the gap between rising expectations and declining opportunities. This is especially true where the population is young, idle, and bored; where the art is impoverished; where entertainment—movies, theater, music—is policed or absent altogether; and where young men are set apart from the consoling and socializing presence of women. Adult illiteracy remained the norm in many Arab countries. Unemployment was among the highest in the developing world. Anger, resentment, and humiliation spurred young Arabs to search for dramatic remedies.

Martyrdom promised such young men an ideal alternative to a life that was so sparing in its rewards. A glorious death beckoned to the sinner, who would be forgiven, it is said, with the first spurt of blood, and he would behold his place in Paradise even before his death. Seventy members of his household might be spared the fires of hell because of his sacrifice. The martyr who is poor will be crowned in heaven with a jewel more valuable than the earth itself. And for those young men who came from cultures where women are shuttered away and rendered unattainable for someone without prospects, martyrdom offered the conjugal pleasures of seventy-two virgins—“the dark-eyed houris,” as the Quran describes them, “chaste as hidden pearls.” They awaited the martyr with feasts of meat and fruit and cups of the purest wine.

For the journalists covering the war, the Arab Afghans were a curious sideshow to the real fighting, set apart by their obsession with dying. When a fighter fell, his comrades would congratulate him and weep because they were not also slain in battle. These scenes struck other Muslims as bizarre.

Takfir is the mirror image of Islam, reversing its fundamental principles but maintaining the semblance of orthodoxy. The Quran explicitly states that Muslims shall not kill anyone, except as punishment for murder. The murderer of one innocent, the Quran warns, is judged “as if he had murdered all of mankind.” The killing of Muslims is an even greater offense. He who commits such an act, says the Quran, will find that “his repayment is Hell, remaining in it timelessly, forever.” How, then, could groups such as al-Jihad and the Islamic Group justify using violence against fellow Muslims in order to come to power?

“We can see a new world coming into view,” Bush told Congress, “in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order…. A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders. A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations.” These words, uttered so hopefully, found a bitter audience in Osama bin Laden. He also wanted to create a new world order, one that was ruled by Muslims, not dictated by America and enforced by the UN. The scale of his ambition was beginning to reveal itself. In his fantasy he would enter history as the savior of Islam.

Some countries simply refused to let the fighters return. They became a stateless, vagrant mob of religious mercenaries. Many of them took root in Pakistan, marrying local women and learning to speak Urdu. Some went to fight in Kashmir, Kosovo, Bosnia, or Chechnya. The cinders of the Afghan conflagration were drifting across the globe, and soon much of the Muslim world would be aflame.

In June 1989, at the same time that the jihad was ending in Afghanistan, Islamists staged a military coup d’état against the civilian, democratic government of Sudan. The leader of the coup was Brigadier General Omar Hasan al-Bashir, but the prime mover was Hasan al-Turabi, one of Africa’s most complex, original, charismatic, and devious characters.

Nonetheless, bin Laden made him head of al-Qaeda’s fatwa committee—a fateful choice. It was on Abu Hajer’s authority that al-Qaeda turned from being the anti-communist Islamic army that bin Laden originally envisioned into a terrorist organization bent on attacking the United States, the last remaining superpower and the force that bin Laden and Abu Hajer believed represented the greatest threat to Islam.

They bitterly perceived the contradiction embodied by Islam’s long, steady retreat from the gates of Vienna, where on September 11—that now resonant date—in 1683, the king of Poland began the battle that turned back the farthest advance of Muslim armies. For the next three hundred years, Islam would be overshadowed by the growth of Western Christian societies. Yet bin Laden and his Arab Afghans believed that, in Afghanistan, they had turned the tide and that Islam was again on the march.

The former conception of al-Qaeda as a mobile army of mujahideen that would defend Muslim lands wherever they were threatened was now cast aside in favor of a policy of permanent subversion of the West. The Soviet Union was dead and communism no longer menaced the margins of the Islamic world. America was the only power capable of blocking the restoration of the ancient Islamic caliphate, and it would have to be confronted and defeated.

As bin Laden passed over Kabul, the capital was under siege once again, this time by the Taliban. They had arisen in 1994 as a small group of students, most of them orphans who had been raised in the refugee camps and who were outraged by the chaos and depravity of the rule of the mujahideen. The liberators in the war against the Soviets had turned out to be more barbaric rulers than their enemy. Stirred to action by the misery that victory had brought to Afghanistan, the Taliban arose with stunning swiftness. Thanks to the support of Pakistani intelligence, they were transformed from a populist militia into a formidable, highly mobile guerrilla army, on the verge of consolidating their rapid rise to power as they stood on the outskirts of Kabul, raining rockets into the ruins.

Prophet’s life when, in 622, ostracized and ridiculed, he was expelled from Mecca and fled to Medina. The hijira, or retreat, as the event is called, was such a significant turning point that it begins the Islamic calendar. The hijira transformed Mohammed and his demoralized followers. Within a few years, their nascent religion burst out of Medina and spread from Spain to China in a blinding flash of conversion and conquest.

But that, as it turned out, was exactly the point. Bin Laden wanted to lure the United States into Afghanistan, which was already being called the graveyard of empires.

Because it had long cultivated ties to informal Islamic networks in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere, Jamaat-e-Islami found itself afloat during the 1970s on a swelling tide of what the French scholar Gilles Kepel would later term “petro dollar Islam,” a vast infusion of proselytizing wealth from Saudi Arabia arising from the 1973 oil boycott staged by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The boycott sent global oil prices soaring. As angry Americans pumped their Chevrolets with dollar-a-gallon gasoline, they filled Saudi and other Persian Gulf treasuries with sudden and unimagined riches.

Despite personal appeals for clemency from President Carter and many other world leaders, Zia sent Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to the gallows in April 1979.

The upheaval in Iran had created new vulnerabilities for the United States in the Middle East. The KGB might seek to exploit this chaos. Here was an opportunity to deflect some of the fire spreading from Khomeini’s pulpit away from the United States and toward the Soviet Union. A sustained rebellion in Afghanistan might constrain the Soviets’ ability to project power into Middle Eastern oil fields. It also might embarrass and tie down Afghan and perhaps Soviet forces as they attempted to quell the uprising.

In the autumn these rumors rebounded on the KGB in a strange case of “blowback,” the term used by spies to describe planted propaganda that filters back to confuse the country that first set the story loose. For reasons that remain unclear, Amin held a series of private meetings in Kabul that fall with American diplomats.

Meeting in Moscow, the Politburo’s inner circle made the first tentative decision to invade on November 26, 1979, just five days after the Jamaat student mob had sacked the U.S. embassy in Islamabad and three weeks after Iranian students had seized hostages at the besieged American embassy in Tehran.

“We should not be too sanguine about Afghanistan becoming a Soviet Vietnam,” he wrote. “The guerrillas are badly organized and poorly led. They have no sanctuary, no organized army, and no central government—all of which North Vietnam had. They have limited foreign support, in contrast to the enormous amount of arms that flowed to the Vietnamese from both the Soviet Union and China. The Soviets are likely to act decisively, unlike the U.S. which pursued in Vietnam a policy of ‘inoculating’ the enemy. “What is to be done?” Brzezinski then asked. He sketched out a new Afghan policy, much of it to be carried out in secret.

“It is essential that Afghanistan’s resistance continues,” he wrote. “This means more money as well as arms shipments to the rebels, and some technical advice. To make the above possible we must both reassure Pakistan and encourage it to help the rebels. This will require a review of our policy toward Pakistan, more guarantees to it, more arms aid, and, alas, a decision that our security policy toward Pakistan cannot be dictated by our nonproliferation policy. We should encourage the Chinese to help the rebels also. We should concert with Islamic countries both in a propaganda campaign and in a covert action campaign to help the rebels.”30 Disguised KGB paramilitaries were still chasing Hafizullah Amin through the hallways of his Kabul palace, Soviet tanks had barely reached their first staging areas, and Brzezinski had already described a CIA-led American campaign in Afghanistan whose broad outlines would stand for a decade to come.

By the early 1980s many Ivy League graduates sought Wall Street wealth, not a relatively low-paid civil service career. American liberals saw the CIA as discredited. Instead of prep school graduates came men like Gary Schroen, working-class midwesterners who had enlisted in the army when others their age were protesting the Vietnam War. They acquired their language skills in CIA classrooms, not on Sorbonne sabbaticals. Many were Republicans or independents. Ronald Reagan was their president. A few of this group inside the Directorate of Operations saw themselves as profane insurgents waging culture and class war against the old CIA elite.

The first guns shipped in were single-shot, bolt-action .303 Lee Enfield rifles, a standard British infantry weapon until the 1950s. With its heavy wooden stock and antique design, it was not an especially exciting weapon, but it was accurate and powerful. Hart regarded it as a far superior weapon to the flashier communist-made AK-47 assault rifle, which looked sleek and made a lot of noise but was less powerful and more difficult to aim.

The border madrassas formed a kind of Islamic ideological picket fence between communist Afghanistan and Pakistan. Gradually Zia embraced jihad as a strategy. He saw the legions of Islamic fighters gathering on the Afghan frontier in the early 1980s as a secret tactical weapon. They accepted martyrdom’s glories. Their faith could trump the superior firepower of the godless Soviet occupiers. “Afghan youth will fight the Soviet invasion with bare hands, if necessary,” he assured President Reagan in private.

Akhtar laid down rules to ensure that ISI would retain control over contacts with Afghan rebels. No American—CIA or otherwise—would be permitted to cross the border into Afghanistan. Movements of weapons within Pakistan and distributions to Afghan commanders would be handled strictly by ISI officers. All training of mujahedin would be carried out solely by ISI in camps along the Afghan frontiers. No CIA officers would train Afghans directly, although when new and complex weapons systems were introduced, ISI would permit the CIA to teach its own Pakistani instructors.

To try to detect any large-scale weapons thefts, the CIA recruited Abdul Haq and a few other Afghan contacts to monitor gun prices in the open markets along the Afghan frontier. If .303 or AK-47 prices fell dramatically, that would indicate that CIA-supplied weapons were being dumped for cash.

Wahhab won the allegiance of the al-Saud tribes to his theology—or they won him to their political cause, depending on which family recounts the history. Either way, Wahhab’s proselytizing merged with the al-Sauds’ military ambition. When the united religious militia overran an oasis, they destroyed grave markers and holy trees and spread the unforgiving word of Allah as interpreted by Wahhab. At one point Wahhab came across a woman accused of fornication and ordered her stoned to death. The preacher’s fearsome legend spread.

Abdul Aziz embraced Wahhabi doctrine. He sponsored a new, fierce, semi-independent vanguard of Ikhwan, or Brothers, war-fighting believers who dressed in distinctive white turbans and trimmed their beards and mustaches to express Islamic solidarity. The Ikhwan conquered village after village, town after town. In Wahhab’s name they enforced bans on alcohol, tobacco, embroidered silk, gambling, fortune-telling, and magic. They denounced telephones, radios, and automobiles as affronts to God’s law. When a motor truck first appeared in their territory, they set it on fire and sent its driver fleeing on foot.

Abdul Aziz skillfully employed the Ikhwan to capture Mecca, Medina, and Jedda between 1914 and 1926. But the king soon felt threatened by the brotherhood’s unquenchable radicalism. The Ikhwan revolted, and Abdul Aziz put them down with modern machine guns. To outflank the brotherhood’s popular appeal to Islamic righteousness, Abdul Aziz founded the Saudi religious police, organized eventually as the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. The king delared that his royal family would govern strictly by the doctrines of Wahhab, enforcing a severe and patriarchal piety shorn of adornment.

Scalability is an ability to adjust the capacity of the system to cost-efficiently fulfill the demands. Scalability usually means an ability to handle more users, clients, data, transactions, or requests without affecting the user experience. It is important to remember that scalability should allow us to scale down as much as scale up and that scaling should be relatively cheap and quick to do.

Virtual private server is a term used by hosting providers to describe a virtual machine for rent. When you purchase a VPS instance, it is hosted together with other VPS instances on a shared host machine. VPS behaves as a regular server—you have your own operating system and full privileges. VPS is cheaper than a dedicated server, as multiple instances can exist at the same time on the same physical machine. VPS is a good starting point, as it is cheap and can usually be upgraded instantly (you can add more random access memory [RAM] and CPU power with a click of a button). Shared hosting is the cheapest hosting solution, where you purchase a user account without administrative privileges. Your account is installed on a server together with many other customers’ accounts. It is a good starting point for the smallest websites or landing pages, but it is too limiting so it is not a recommended option.

Vertical scalability is accomplished by upgrading the hardware and/or network throughput. It is often the simplest solution for short-term scalability, as it does not require architectural changes to your application. If you are running your server with 8GB of memory, it is easy to upgrade to 32GB or even 128GB by just replacing the hardware. You do not have to modify the way your application works or add any abstraction layers to support this way of scaling. If you are hosting your application on virtual servers, scaling vertically may be as easy as a few clicks to order an upgrade of your virtual server instance to a more powerful one.

Adding more memory means more space for the file system cache and more working memory for the applications. Memory size is especially important for efficiency of database servers.

The practical simplicity of vertical scaling is its main advantage, as you do not have to rearchitect anything. Unfortunately, vertical scaling comes with some serious limitations, the main one being cost. Vertical scalability becomes extremely expensive beyond a certain point.

The second biggest issue with vertical scalability is that it actually has hard limits. No matter how much money you may be willing to spend, it is not possible to continually add memory. Similar limits apply to CPU speed, number of cores per server, and hard drive speed. Simply put, at a certain point, no hardware is available that could support further growth.

Finally, operating system design or the application itself may prevent you from scaling vertically beyond a certain point. For example, you will not be able to keep adding CPUs to keep scaling MySQL infinitely, due to increasing lock contention (especially if you use an older MySQL storage engine called MyISAM).

Locks are used to synchronize access between execution threads to shared resources like memory or files. Lock contention is a performance bottleneck caused by inefficient lock management. Operations performed very often should have fine-grained locks; otherwise, your application may spend most of its time waiting for locks to be released. Once you hit a lock contention bottleneck, adding more CPU cores does not increase the overall throughput.

The core concept behind isolation of services is that you should try to split your monolithic web application into a set of distinct functional parts and host them independently. The process of dividing a system based on functionality to scale it independently is called functional partitioning.

A content delivery network is a hosted service that takes care of global distribution of static files like images, JavaScript, CSS, and videos. It works as an HTTP proxy. Clients that need to download images, JavaScript, CSS, or videos connect to one of the servers owned by the CDN provider instead of your servers. If the CDN server does not have the requested content yet, it asks your server for it and caches it from then on. Once the file is cached by the CDN, subsequent clients are served without contacting your servers at all.

During one of the Egyptian government crackdowns, an imprisoned radical named Sayyed Qutb, who had tried unsuccessfully to assassinate Nasser, wrote from a jail cell a manifesto titled Signposts, which argued for a new Leninist approach to Islamic revolution. Qutb justified violence against nonbelievers and urged radical action to seize political power. His opinions had taken shape, at least in part, during a yearlong visit to the United States in 1948. The Egyptian government had sent him to Northern Colorado Teachers College in Greeley to learn about the American educational system, but he found the United States repugnant. America was materialistic, obsessed with sex, prejudiced against Arabs, and sympathetic to Israel. “Humanity today is living in a large brothel! One has only to glance at its press, films, fashion shows, beauty contests, ballrooms, wine bars, and broadcasting stations!” Qutb wrote upon his return.

By the time he repelled his sixth Soviet offensive, in 1982, Massoud had made a name for himself nationwide. He was the “Lion of the Panjshir.” The word Panjshir itself had become a rallying cry across Afghanistan and abroad, a symbol of hope for the anticommunist resistance.

Massoud felt the truce would raise his stature by placing him on equal footing with a superpower. “The Russians have negotiated with a valley,” his aide Massoud Khalili crowed. The deal also bought Massoud time to regroup for what he had determined would be a long, long fight ahead. He sought not only to resist the Soviets but to compete for power in Kabul and on a national stage, as the revolutionaries he admired from his reading had done. Despite the uncertainties of the war, he planned early for a conventional army that could occupy Kabul after the Soviets left.

The CIA, honoring its agreement with Zia to work solely through ISI, had no direct contacts with Massoud during the early 1980s. ISI officers in the Afghan bureau saw the British “playing their own game” with Massoud, which provided yet another reason to withhold support from him. But the CIA did begin in late 1984 to secretly pass money and light supplies to Massoud without telling Pakistan.

After several rounds of debate and teeth-gnashing, a compromise was reached: The guns could be shipped to Pakistan, but they would be stripped of the night-vision goggles and scopes that seemed to tilt their “most likely use” toward assassination. Also, the CIA would not provide ISI with target intelligence from satellites concerning where Soviet officers lived or how their apartment buildings might be approached stealthily. CIA officers tried to emphasize to ISI the guns’ value as “antimaterial” weapons, meaning that they could be used to shoot out the tires in a convoy of trucks from a distant mountaintop or to drill holes in a fuel tanker. American specialists traveled to Pakistan to train ISI officers on the rifles so that they, in turn, could train rebel commando teams. In the end, dozens of the sniper rifles were shipped to Afghanistan.

The CIA had several problems in confronting the global terrorist threat, Clarridge wrote. The biggest was its “defensive mentality.” Terrorists operated worldwide “knowing there was little chance of retribution or of their being brought to justice.” Clarridge wanted a new legal operating system for the CIA that would allow offensive strikes against terrorists. He proposed the formation of two super-secret “action teams” that would be funded and equipped to track, attack, and snatch terrorists globally. The action teams would be authorized to kill terrorists if doing so would preempt a terrorist event, or arrest them and bring them to justice if possible. One action team would be made up of foreign nationals who could blend more easily into landscapes overseas. The other action team would be Americans.

Abdullah Azzam preached stridently against the United States. He would soon help found Hamas. Prince Turki al-Faisal and Saudi intelligence became important supporters. Azzam circulated in a world apart from the official Americans in Pakistan. Even relatively neutral European aid workers living in Peshawar had only sporadic contact with him.

He opened his first training facility in 1986, modeled on those just over the barren hills run by Pakistani intelligence. Young Arab jihadists would learn how to use assault rifles, explosives, and detonators, and they would listen to lectures about why they had been called to fight. Bin Laden called his first training camp “the Lion’s Den,” by some accounts, “al Ansar” (a name of the earliest followers of the Prophet Mohammed) by others. And despite Abdullah Azzam’s questions, he declared that he was going ahead with his other projects at Jaji. “Inshallah [if it is God’s will], you will know my plans,” bin Laden told his mentor.

At the same time that Gorbachev was deciding secretly to initiate a withdrawal of his battered forces from Afghanistan, the CIA’s Directorate of Intelligence circulated a report that the Afghan war “has not been a substantial drain on the Soviet economy” and that Moscow “shows continued willingness to incur whatever burden is necessary.” At the CIA station in Islamabad “it still looked as though the war might just go on indefinitely or that the Soviets might even be on the verge of winning

Gorbachev seemed genuinely stunned to discover that the Americans didn’t seem to want to negotiate about Afghanistan or the future of Central Asia at all. They remained devoted to their militaristic jihad, and they did not appear to take the possibility of a Soviet withdrawal at all seriously. At times it made Gorbachev furious. “ The U.S. has set for itself the goal of disrupting a settlement in Afghanistan by any means,” he told his inner circle. What were his options? Gorbachev wanted to end Soviet involvement. He doubted the Afghans could handle the war on their own, but in any settlement he wanted to preserve Soviet power and prestige. “A million of our soldiers went through Afghanistan,” he observed.

Chronicled daily at the time by several Arab journalists who observed the fighting from a mile or two away, the battle of Jaji marked the birth of Osama bin Laden’s public reputation as a warrior among Arab jihadists. When Winston Churchill recounted an 1897 battle he fought with the British army not far from the Khyber Pass, he remarked that there was no more thrilling sensation than being shot at and missed. Bin Laden apparently had a similar experience.

The personal connections that had bound the CIA and ISI together during the jihad’s early years were now broken. Back in Washington, the CIA was on the political defensive. Casey’s postmortem reputation was plummeting under the weight of Iran-Contra indictments. Everything he had touched now appeared tainted.

By the late 1980s ISI had effectively eliminated all the secular, leftist, and royalist political parties that had first formed when Afghan refugees fled communist rule. Still, Bearden defended ISI’s strategy adamantly before every visiting congressional delegation, during briefings in the embassy bubble, and over touristic lunches in the mountains above Peshawar. The mission was to kill Soviets, Bearden kept repeating. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar killed Soviets. The king of Afghanistan, twirling pasta on his spoon outside Rome, had not killed a single one. The CIA was not going to have its jihad run “by some liberal arts jerkoff.”

There was no American policy on Afghan politics at the time, only the de facto promotion of Pakistani goals as carried out by Pakistani intelligence. The CIA forecasted repeatedly during this period that postwar Afghanistan was going to be an awful mess; nobody could prevent that. Let the Pakistanis sort out the regional politics.

Gates joined Shultz and his top aides at Foggy Bottom on February 19. The CIA’s analysts were united in the belief that post-Soviet Afghanistan “would be messy, with a struggle for power among different mujahedin groups, and that the outcome would most likely be a weak central government and powerful tribal leaders in the countryside.” But as to Najibullah, most of the CIA’s analysts simply did not believe his government could survive without active military support by Soviet forces.

The State Department recommended Edmund McWilliams. He was nominated as U.S. special envoy to the Afghan rebels and dispatched to the U.S. embassy in Islamabad in the late spring of 1988. McWilliams was energized by his assignment. He would be able to report independently about the late stages of the Afghan jihad, circulate his cables to the CIA, State Department, and Congress, and provide a fresh, independent voice on the main controversies in U.S. policy at a critical moment.

Charlie Wilson flew out on the plane with Shultz, as did Armitage and Armacost. They huddled together across the aisles, talking about contingencies, and they scratched out a new American policy toward Pakistan, literally on the fly. The United States would deepen ties to the Pakistani military, including Pakistani intelligence. They would need this intimate alliance more than ever now to get through the post-Zia transition. They would also support democratic elections for a new civilian government. Zia had been moving in this direction anyway; a date for national voting had been set. And they would help defend Pakistan from any external threats.

Nearly every Afghan he met impressed upon him the same message: As the Soviets withdrew, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar—backed by officers in ISI’s Afghan bureau, operatives from the Muslim Brotherhood’s Jamaat-e-Islami, officers from Saudi intelligence, and Arab volunteers from a dozen countries—was moving systematically to wipe out his rivals in the Afghan resistance.

This was especially true inside ISI’s Afghan bureau. “I wonder if these people would ever have held elections if they knew that we were going to win,” Bhutto remarked to her foreign policy adviser Iqbal Akhund on a flight to China in 1989. Akhund, cynical about ISI’s competence, told her: “You owe your prime ministership to the intelligence agencies who, as always, gave the government a wishful assessment of how the elections would—or could be made to—turn out.”

Earlier, as Soviet troops prepared to leave Afghanistan, the United States had decided not to help Afghans negotiate a peaceful political transition because the CIA believed Najibullah would fall quickly. The CIA also feared that political talks would slow down the Soviet departure. McWilliams believed those arguments had now been overtaken by events. To prevent Pakistan from installing its anti-American clients in Kabul, to prevent further suffering by Afghan civilians, and to rebuild a stable and centrist politics in Afghanistan, the United States now had to ease off on its covert military strategy and begin to sponsor a broader political settlement, he argued.

It was a rare direct encounter between CIA officers and the Arab volunteers their jihad had attracted to the border. It signaled the beginning of a fateful turn in the covert war, but few inside the agency grasped the implications. The CIA did accumulate and transmit to Langley more and more facts about the Arab volunteers and their activities. By the summer of 1989 the agency’s network of Afghan agents described the Arabs operating in Paktia and farther south as a rising force and a rising problem.

The Arabs in University Town’s salons argued about theology, too. Hekmatyar and Massoud both agreed that communist and capitalist systems were both corrupt because they were rooted in jahiliyya, the state of primitive barbarism that prevailed before Islam lit the world with truth. In this sense the Soviet Union and the United States were equally evil. Hekmatyar and Massoud also accepted that Islam was not only a personal faith but a body of laws and systems—the proper basis for politics and government. The goal of jihad was to establish an Islamic government in Afghanistan in order to implement these laws and ideals. Hekmatyar and Massoud also both endorsed Qutb’s concept of takfir, by which true believers could identify imposter Muslims who had strayed from true Islam, and then proclaim these false Muslims kaffir, or outside of the Islamic community. Such imposters should be overthrown no matter how hard they worked to drape themselves in Islamic trappings. Najibullah was one such false ruler, they agreed.

Only after Oakley warned of the gravest consequences for American-Pakistani relations if Pakistani intelligence did not abandon the plan did Durrani, the ISI chief, agree to call off the attack and turn the trucks back. “Tanai Two,” as the planned mass rocket attack came to be known in the Islamabad embassy, had been aborted in the nick of time, but it signaled the Pakistani army’s deepening break with American priorities. Oakley, now more firmly opposed to Pakistani intelligence than he had been during McWilliams’s tour, denounced ISI as “a rogue elephant” in a meeting with Pakistan’s president.

The dominant view among Pakistani generals, whether they were Islamists or secularists, was that Hekmatyar offered the best hope for a pro-Pakistan government in Kabul. The strong feeling even among the most liberal Punjabi generals—whose sons cavorted in London and who spent their own afternoons on the army’s Rawalpindi golf course—was “We should settle this business. It’s a sore on our backside.”

Pakistan was now just one or two metaphorical turns of a screw away from possessing nuclear bombs, and the CIA knew it. Under an American law known as the Pressler Amendment, the CIA’s conclusion automatically triggered the end of American military and economic assistance to the government of Pakistan—$564 million in aid that year.28 After a decade of intensive U.S.-Pakistan cooperation, the United States had decided, in effect, to file for divorce.

BY EARLY 1991 the Afghan policies pursued by the State Department and the CIA were in open competition with one another. Both departments sought a change of government in Kabul, but they had different Afghan clients. Peter Tomsen and his supporters in State’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research pursued what they saw as a bottom-up or grassroots strategy. They channeled guns and money to the new rebel commanders’ shura, which attracted members from across Afghanistan, and they emphasized the importance of Massoud. They also continued to negotiate for a broad political settlement that would include popular national figures such as the exiled king. The CIA sometimes cooperated with these efforts, however grudgingly, but it also continued to collaborate with Pakistani intelligence on a separate military track that mainly promoted Hekmatyar and other Islamist commanders operating near the Pakistani border. That winter the ISI and the CIA returned to the strategy that had been tried unsuccessfully in the two previous years: a massed attack on an eastern Afghan city, with direct participation by covert Pakistani forces.

In Afghanistan the stage was set not for a triumphal reconciliation on one of the Cold War’s most destructive battlefields but for an ugly new phase of regional and civil war.

From fertile Helmand in the south to the gorge valleys of the northeast, Afghanistan flowered each spring with one of the world’s largest crops of opium poppies. Untroubled by government, and funded by smugglers and organized crime networks rooted in Pakistan, Afghan poppy farmers supplied heroin labs nestled in cities and along the lawless Afghanistan-Pakistan border. By 1992 hundreds of tons of refined heroin flowed from these labs east through Karachi’s port or north through the new overland routes of the Russian mafia, destined for European cities. By the early 1990s, Afghanistan rivaled Colombia and Burma as a fountainhead of global heroin supply.

On February 26, 1993, just a month after Kasi’s highly publicized attack at the CIA, Yousef led his confederates in a two-vehicle convoy from Brooklyn to the B-2 level of an underground garage at the World Trade Center. Yousef set an electronic timer on the bomb and jumped into a rented red Chevrolet Corsica. The materials needed to construct Yousef’s bomb cost about $400. When it detonated at 12:18 P.M., it killed six people lunching in a cafeteria above it, injured one thousand more who worked several floors higher, and caused just over $500 million in estimated damage. That night Yousef boarded a Pakistan International Airlines flight to Karachi and disappeared.

Americans were still much more likely to die from bee stings than from terrorist strikes during the early 1990s. In that respect it made more sense to treat terrorism as a law enforcement problem. Prosecuting and jailing a terrorist as an ordinary murderer effectively dismissed his claims to political legitimacy. This seemed to many American national security thinkers a more rational reply to terrorists than waging a paramilitary war or treating some half-educated Marxist thug with the dignity accorded to enemy soldiers.

The CIA was created to prevent another Pearl Harbor. But in the aftermath of a catastrophic war against Nazism, Congress also sought to protect the American people from the rise of anything like Hitler’s Gestapo, a secret force that combined spying and police methods. The CIA was therefore prohibited from spying on Americans or using intelligence it collected abroad to support directly criminal prosecutions in the American court system.

Horizontal scalability is accomplished by a number of methods to allow increased capacity by adding more servers. Horizontal scalability is considered the holy grail of scalability, as it overcomes the increasing cost of capacity unit associated with scaling by buying ever-stronger hardware. In addition, when scaling horizontally you can always add more servers—you never reach a hard limit, as is the case with vertical scalability.

Horizontal scalability technologies often pay off at the later stage. Initially they tend to cost more because they are more complex and require more work. Sometimes they cost more because you need more servers for the most basic setup, and other times it is because you need more experienced engineers to build and operate them. The important thing to note is that once you pass a certain point of necessary capacity, horizontal scalability becomes a better strategy. Using horizontal scalability, you avoid the high prices of top-tier hardware and you also avoid hitting the vertical scalability ceiling (where there is no more powerful hardware).

Round-robin DNS is a DNS server feature allowing you to resolve a single domain name to one of many IP addresses. The regular DNS server takes a domain name, like ejsmont.org, and resolves it to a single IP address, like 173.236.152.169. Thus, round-robin DNS allows you to map the domain name to multiple IP addresses, each IP pointing to a different machine. Then, each time a client asks for the name resolution, DNS responds with one of the IP addresses. The goal is to direct traffic from each client to one of the web servers—different clients may be connected to different servers without realizing it. Once a client receives an IP address, it will only communicate with the selected server.

GeoDNS is a DNS service that allows domain names to be resolved to IP addresses based on the location of the customer. Regular DNS servers receive a domain name, like yahoo.com, and resolve it to an IP address, like 206.190.36.45. GeoDNS behaves the same way from the client’s perspective. However, it may serve different IP addresses based on the location of the client. A client connecting from Europe may get a different IP address than the client connecting from Australia. As a result, clients from both Europe and Australia could connect to the web servers hosted closer to their location. In short, the goal is to direct the customer to the closest data center to minimize network latency.

Edge cache is a HTTP cache server located near the customer, allowing the customer to partially cache the HTTP traffic. Requests from the customer’s browser go to the edge-cache server. The server can then decide to serve the page from the cache, or it can decide to assemble the missing pieces of the page by sending background requests to your web servers. It can also decide that the page is uncacheable and delegate fully to your web servers. Edge-cache servers can serve entire pages or cache fragments of HTTP responses.

The domain model explains key terms, actors, and operations, without caring about technical implementation. The domain model of an automated teller machine (ATM) would mention things like cash, account, debit, credit, authentication, security policies, etc. At the same time, the domain model would be oblivious to hardware and software implementation of the problem.

We will also be able to scale front-end servers independently, as they will not need to perform complex processing or share much state, but may be exposed to high concurrency challenges.

Kandahar lay uncomfortably exposed in a semiarid plain between the two great Islamic empires of the day: Persia, to the west, and the Mughal Empire, ruled from Kabul to the north. In the Pashtun homeland luscious orchards and farms dotted the banks of the snaking Helmand River. Mud-walled villages unmolested by outside authority nestled in fertile valleys. Swift snowmelt rivers in the surrounding hills seemed to invigorate the strong-boned, strong-willed pathwalkers who drank from them. The desert highways crossing Kandahar carried great caravans between India and Persia, providing road taxes for local governors and loot for tribal highwaymen. Yet Kandahar’s fractious tribes lacked the administrative and military depth of Persia’s throne or the natural defenses of Kabul’s rock-mountain gorges. The region’s two great tribal confederations were the Ghilzais, whose dispersed members lived to the north, toward Jalalabad, and the Abdalis, centered in Kandahar. They marauded against neighbors and passing armies. Chieftains of lineage clans consulted in circle-shaped egalitarian jirgas, where they forged alliances and authorized tribal risings as cyclical and devastating as monsoons. But they had yet to win an empire of their own.

The most powerful Abdali chiefs had elected the weakest among them as leader, giving them flexibility to rebel whenever they wished. This was a pattern of Pashtun decision-making about kings and presidents that would persist into the twenty-first century.

Having the front end developed as a separate application within our system gives us another advantage: we can use a different technology stack to develop it. It is not unreasonable to use one technology to develop web services and a different one to develop the front-end application. As an example, you could develop the front end using Groovy, PHP, or Ruby, and web services could be developed in pure Java.

Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is architecture centered on loosely coupled and highly autonomous services focused on solving business needs. In SOA, it is preferred that all the services have clearly defined contracts and use the same communication protocols. I don’t consider SOAP, REST, JSON, or XML in the definition of SOA, as they are implementation details. It does not matter what technology you use or what protocols are involved as long as your services are loosely coupled and specialized in solving a narrow set of business needs. I will explain coupling and best design principles in the next chapter.

A multilayer architecture is a way to divide functionality into a set of layers. Components in the lower layers expose an application programming interface (API) that can be consumed by clients residing in the layers above, but you can never allow lower layers to depend on the functionality provided by the upper layers. A good example of layered architecture is an operating system and its components, as shown in Figure 1-12. Here, you have hardware, device drivers, operating system kernel, operating system libraries, third-party libraries, and third-party applications. Each layer is consuming services provided by the layers below, but never vice versa. Another good example is the TCP/IP programming stack, where each layer adds functionality and depends on the contract provided by the layer below.

The birth and rise of the Taliban during 1994 and the emergence of the movement’s supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, were often described in the United States and Europe as the triumph of a naïve, pious, determined band of religious students swept into power on a wave of popular revulsion over Kandahar’s criminal warlords. The Taliban themselves emphasized this theme after they acquired power. As they constructed their founding narrative, they weaved in stories of Mullah Omar’s visionary dreams for a new Islamic order for Afghanistan. They described his heroic rescue of abducted girls from warlord rapists. They publicized his yen for popular justice, as illustrated by the public hanging of depraved kidnappers.

Taliban, which can be translated as “students of Islam” or “seekers of knowledge,” had been part of traditional village life in Kandahar’s conservative “Koran belt” since even before the time of Ahmed Shah Durrani. Taliban were as familiar to southern Pashtun villagers as frocked Catholic priests were in the Irish countryside, and they played a similar role. They taught schoolchildren, led prayers, comforted the dying, and mediated local disputes. They studied in hundreds of small madrassas, memorizing the Koran, and they lived modestly on the charity of villagers.

In a region unfamiliar with formal government, these religious travelers provided a loose Islamic civil service.

An important side effect of layered architecture is increased stability as you go deeper into the layers. You can change the API of upper layers freely since few things depend on them. On the other hand, changing the API of lower layers may be expensive because there may be a lot of code that depends on the existing API.

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is, simply put, a different way of thinking about actions. Event-driven architecture, as the name implies, is about reacting to events that have already happened. Traditional architecture is about responding to requests and requesting work to be done. In a traditional programming model we think of ourselves as a person requesting something to be done, for example, createUserAccount(). We typically expect this operation to be performed while we are waiting for a result, and once we get the result, we continue our processing. In the event-driven model, we don’t wait for things to be done. Whenever we have to interact with other components, we announce things that have already happened and proceed with our own processing. Analogous to the previous example, we could announce an event UserAccountFormSubmitted. This mental shift leads to many interesting implications.

Think of the web services layer as a set of highly autonomous applications, where each web service becomes an application itself. Web services may depend on each other, but the less they depend on each other, the better. A higher level of abstraction provided by services allows you to see the entire system and still understand it. Each service hides the details of its implementation and presents a simplified, high-level API.

The date was October 27, 1915. The name of the ship was Endurance. The position was 69°5' South, 51°30' West—deep in the icy wasteland of the Antarctic’s treacherous Weddell Sea, just about midway between the South Pole and the nearest known outpost of humanity, some 1,200 miles away.

It had been very nearly a year since they had last been in contact with civilization. Nobody in the outside world knew they were in trouble, much less where they were. They had no radio transmitter with which to notify any would-be rescuers, and it is doubtful that any rescuers could have reached them even if they had been able to broadcast an SOS. It was 1915, and there were no helicopters, no Weasels, no Sno-Cats, no suitable planes. Thus their plight was naked and terrifying in its simplicity. If they were to get out—they had to get themselves out.

There, in 1903, twelve years before, the crew of a Swedish ship had spent the winter after their vessel, the Antarctic, had been crushed by the Weddell Sea ice. The ship which finally rescued that party deposited its stock of stores on Paulet Island for the use of any later castaways. Ironically, it was Shackleton himself who had been commissioned at the time to purchase those stores—and now, a dozen years later, it was he who needed them.

Evidence of the scope of such an undertaking is the fact that after Shackleton’s failure, the crossing of the continent remained untried for fully forty-three years—until 1957–1958. Then, as an independent enterprise conducted during the International Geophysical Year, Dr. Vivian E. Fuchs led the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition on the trek. And even Fuchs, though his party was equipped with heated, tracked vehicles and powerful radios, and guided by reconnaissance planes and dog teams, was strongly urged to give up. It was only after a tortuous journey lasting nearly four months that Fuchs did in fact achieve what Shackleton set out to do in 1915.

She proceeded out the ever-widening mouth of the River Platte, and dropped her pilot the next morning at the Recalada Lightship. By sunset the land had dropped from sight.

Then, on February 14, an excellent lead of water opened a quarter of a mile ahead of the ship. Steam was hurriedly raised and all hands were ordered onto the ice with saws, chisels, picks, and any other tools that could be used to cut a lane through the floes. The Endurance lay in a pool of young ice only about a foot or two thick. This was systematically sawed and rafted away to give the ship room to batter at the floes ahead. The crew started work at 8:40 A.M., and worked throughout the day. By midnight they had carved out a channel about 150 yards long.

The conversion of the Endurance from a ship into a kind of floating shore station brought with it a marked slowdown in the tempo of life. There simply wasn’t much for the men to do. The winter schedule required of them only about three hours’ work a day, and the rest of the time they were free to do what they wanted.

Though he was virtually fearless in the physical sense, he suffered an almost pathological dread of losing control of the situation. In part, this attitude grew out of a consuming sense of responsibility. He felt he had gotten them into their situation, and it was his responsibility to get them out.

Now, in every direction, there was nothing to be seen but the endless ice.

Shackleton’s aversion to tempting fate was well known. This attitude had earned for him the nickname “Old Cautious” or “Cautious Jack.” But nobody ever called him that to his face. He was addressed simply as “Boss”—by officers, scientists, and seamen alike. It was really more a title than a nickname. It had a pleasant ring of familiarity about it, but at the same time “Boss” had the connotation of absolute authority. It was therefore particularly apt, and exactly fitted Shackleton’s outlook and behavior.

None of them, however, could possibly have felt their defeat so intensely as Shackleton, to whom the thought of quitting was abhorrent. He wrote in his diary that night, with characteristically peculiar punctuation: “Turned in but could not sleep. Thought the whole matter over & decided to retreat to more secure ice: it is the only safe thing to do. . . . Am anxious: For so big a party & 2 boats in bad conditions we could do nothing: I do not like retreating but prudence demands this course: Everyone working well except the carpenter: I shall never forget him in this time of strain & stress.”

But at the same time, the basic egotism that gave rise to his enormous self-reliance occasionally blinded him to realities.

Under the best circumstances it would have been upsetting news. Under their present circumstances it was amplified in the minds of some men almost to a catastrophe. In their bitterness, a few, like Greenstreet, were inclined to fix the blame on Shackleton—with some justification: “. . . the present shortage of food,” Greenstreet wrote, “is due simply and solely from the Boss refusing to get seals when they were to be had and even refusing to let Orde-Lees to go out to look for them. . . . His sublime optimism all the way thro being to my mind absolute foolishness.

Macklin wrote on May 22: “There is a big change in the scenery about here—everything is now covered with snow, and there is a considerable ice foot to both sides of the spit. For the last few days ice has been coming in, and dense pack extends in all directions as far as the eye can reach, making the chances of a near rescue seem very remote. No ship but a properly constructed ice-ship would be safe in this pack; an iron steamer would be smashed up very soon. Besides this there is very little daylight now. . .

After a time, however, Wild succumbed to mounting pressure and a 2-gallon gasoline can was made into a urinal for use at night. The rule was that the man who raised its level to within 2 inches of the top had to carry the can outside and empty it. If a man felt the need and the weather outside was bad, he would lie awake waiting for somebody else to go so that he might judge from the sound the level of the can’s contents.

The memories of everything up to now, he wrote, “flit through our minds as a chaotic, confused nightmare. The past twelve months appear to have passed speedily enough and though we have been dwelling here in a life of security for nearly 4 months, this latter period seems longer than the preceding balance of the year. This doubtless is occasioned by our counting the days and the daily expectations of deferred relief, as well as our having no . . . work to perform. . . . The watching day by day and the anxiety for the safety of our comrades of the Caird lay a holding hand on the already retarded passage of time.”

The sight that the Caird presented was one of the most incongruous imaginable. Here was a patched and battered 22-foot boat, daring to sail alone across the world’s most tempestuous sea, her rigging festooned with a threadbare collection of clothing and half-rotten sleeping bags. Her crew consisted of six men whose faces were black with caked soot and half-hidden by matted beards, whose bodies were dead white from constant soaking in salt water.

The strain on Shackleton was so great that he lost his temper over a trivial incident. A small, bob-tailed bird appeared over the boat and flew annoyingly about, like a mosquito intent on landing. Shackleton stood it for several minutes, then he leaped to his feet, swearing and batting furiously at the bird with his arms. But he realized at once the poor example he had set and dropped back down again with a chagrined expression on his face.

Worsley thought to himself of the pity of it all. He remembered the diary he had kept ever since the Endurance had sailed from South Georgia almost seventeen months before. That same diary, wrapped in rags and utterly soaked, was now stowed in the forepeak of the Caird. When she went, it would go, too. Worsley thought not so much of dying, because that was now so plainly inevitable, but of the fact that no one would ever know how terribly close they had come.

It was an utterly carefree journey as the Caird drove smartly across the sparkling water. After a while they even began to sing. It occurred to Shackleton that they could easily have been mistaken for a picnic party out for a lark—except perhaps for their woebegone appearance.

Velocity is relative. It doesn’t make any sense unless you are comparing two objects. A car on the freeway might be going 70 miles per hour compared to the ground, but compared to the car next to it, it’s moving almost 0. So what is that “measured velocity” measuring the velocity of?

I peer at the diagram more closely. Why is there 20,000 kilograms of Astrophage on this ship? I’ve got a strong suspicion. It’s the fuel. And why not? Astrophage can propel itself with light and has absurd energy-storage capability. It’s had God-knows-how-many billion years of evolution to get good at it.

The key had to be frequencies of light. My boys didn’t wiggle at all in darkness. But it wasn’t just about the sheer volume of light, or they would have gone for the LED. It had to be something about the frequency of the light. Planets don’t just reflect light. They also emit it. Everything emits light. The temperature of the object defines the wavelength of light emitted. Planets are no exception. So maybe Astrophage looked for Venus’s IR signature. It wouldn’t be as bright as Mercury’s, but it would be distinct—a different “color.”

When light hits gas molecules, the electrons get all worked up. Then they calm down and re-emit the energy as light. But the frequency of the photons they emit is very specific to the molecules involved. Astronomers used this for decades to know what gases are out there far, far away. That’s what spectroscopy is all about.

Astrophage can, apparently, do this in either direction. It takes heat energy and somehow turns it into mass.

“Eridians not know how long sleep last. Maybe short time. Maybe long time.” They sleep unpredictable amounts of time. I guess there’s no rule saying sleep has to evolve as a regular pattern. Does he at least know a range of times it might be? “Is there a minimum time? A maximum time?” “Minimum is 12,265 seconds. Maximum is 42,928 seconds.” I often get strangely specific numbers from Rocky on things that should be rough estimates. It took me a while to figure out, but I finally did. He actually is coming up with rough, round numbers. But they’re in his units and in base six. It’s actually easier for him to convert those values to base-ten Earth seconds than it is for him to think directly in Earth seconds.

Astrophage makes neutrinos in pairs by slamming protons together. For the reaction to work, the protons need to collide with a higher kinetic energy than the mass energy of two neutrinos. If you work backward from the mass of a neutrino, you know the velocity those protons have to collide at. And when you know the velocity of particles in an object, you know its temperature. To have enough kinetic energy to make neutrinos, the protons have to be 96.415 degrees Celsius.

Planets get magnetic fields if the conditions are right. You have to have a molten-iron core, you have to be in the magnetic field of a star, and you have to be spinning. If all three of these things are true, you get a magnetic field. Earth has one—that’s why compasses work.

You know what strong magnetic fields and thick atmospheres are really good at? Radiation protection. All life on Earth evolved to deal with radiation.

For Erid, it’s 100 percent. Radiation just doesn’t get to the ground. Light doesn’t even get to the ground—that’s why they never evolved eyes. The surface is pitch-dark. How does a biosphere exist in total darkness? I haven’t asked Rocky how that works yet, but there is plenty of life deep in Earth’s oceans where the sun doesn’t shine. So it’s definitely doable.

Eridians invented space travel quite a while ago. And with their unparalleled materials technology (xenonite) they actually made a space elevator. Basically a cable leading from Erid’s equator up to the synchronous orbit with a counterweight. They literally take elevators to get into orbit.

So that’s what I’m left with. Option 1: Go home a hero and save all of humanity. Option 2: Go to Erid, save an alien species, and starve to death shortly after. I pull on my hair. I sob into my hands. It’s cathartic and exhausting. All I see when I close my eyes is Rocky’s dumb carapace and his little arms always fidgeting with something.

I’ve got a number that’s bigger than a googolplex. Jacob Bekenstein invented a formula allowing us to estimate the maximum number of different quantum states that could have a mass and size comparable to our observable universe. Given the quantum fuzziness we observe, that would be the maximum number of distinct observable universes like ours. It’s 10^(10^124), a number that has 1024 times as many zeros as a googolplex. These 10^(10^124) universes range from ones that are scary, filled with mostly black holes, to ones that are exactly like ours but where your nostril is missing one oxygen molecule and some space alien’s nostril has one more.

We can’t get vacuums that empty in our best laboratories. There is an old saying, “Nature abhors a vacuum.” The people who said that never left Earth’s surface. In fact, Nature just loves a vacuum, because that’s what most of the universe is. When they said “Nature,” they were just referring to where we are now, at the base of this blanket of air we call our atmosphere, which does indeed rush in to fill empty spaces whenever it can.

The protons are moving fast. Really fast, in fact. Two protons normally repel each other, because they have the same (positive) charge. But if you move fast enough, you can overcome that repulsion. You can get close enough so that a brand-new force kicks in—not the repulsive electrostatic force, but an attractive force that manifests over a very short range. If you get two protons close enough, within that short range they will stick together. This force has a name. We call it the strong force. Yes, that’s the official name for it. This strong nuclear force can bind protons together and make new elements out of them, such as the next element after hydrogen on the periodic table, helium. Stars are in the business of making elements heavier than those they are born with. And this process happens deep in the core.

If the first day of winter is the shortest day of the year, what must be true for every other day of winter? They must get longer. So days get longer in the winter, not shorter. You don’t need a PhD or a grant from the National Science Foundation to figure that out. Hours of daylight get longer during the winter and shorter during the summer.

From this we conclude the obvious fact that the Sun’s visible light is not being absorbed by the air, otherwise, you wouldn’t see the Sun at all. If you are indoors in a room with no windows, you can’t see the Sun, because the roof of your building is absorbing the visible light from the Sun. You must either look out a transparent window or go outside to see the Sun.

A star halfway up in the sky as seen from the North Pole circles Polaris as Earth turns, always staying above the horizon. A star right on the horizon circles along the horizon, so every star you can see stays above the horizon. No star rises, no star sets; they all circle Polaris overhead, and you see the entire Northern Hemisphere of the sky. That’s Santa’s view.

Christopher Columbus set sail at a fixed latitude that he maintained for his entire journey across the Atlantic Ocean. Go back and look at his maps. That’s how they navigated; they kept at that latitude by keeping Polaris at the same altitude above the horizon during the trip.

Of course the Greeks were not the only people to weave a tapestry of legends and lore out of the puzzling fabric of existence. The gods of Greece, if we are archaeological and palaeoanthropological about it all, can be traced back to the sky fathers, moon goddesses and demons of the ‘fertile crescent’ of Mesopotamia – today’s Iraq, Syria and Turkey. The Babylonians, Sumerians, Akkadians and other civilizations there, which first flourished far earlier than the Greeks, had their creation stories and folk myths which, like the languages that expressed them, could find ancestry in India and thence westwards back to prehistory, Africa and the birth of our species.

Greeks did not grovel before their gods. They were aware of their vain need to be supplicated and venerated, but they believed men were their equal.

Each of the five rescued ones took it in turn to embrace Zeus, their youngest but now eldest brother, their saviour and their leader. They swore allegiance to him for ever. Together they would overthrow Kronos and his whole ugly race and establish a new order … They would not, despite their parentage, call themselves ‘Titans’. They would be gods. And not just gods, but the gods.

But just as Ouranos had paid dearly for his crime of imprisoning the Cyclopes and Hecatonchires inside Gaia, so Kronos was about to pay for the blunder of imprisoning them in the caverns of Tartarus.

One of the original Titans, Mnemosyne (Memory), was mother by Zeus to nine highly intelligent and creative daughters, the Muses, who lived at various times on Mount Helicon (where the Hippocrene fountain later played), on Mount Parnassus above Delphi, and in Pieria in Thessaly where the Pierian Spring, the metaphorical source of all the arts and sciences, flowed.

Hidden in a cave while the battle roared outside, Eurynome bore Zeus three ravishing daughters, AGLAEA (which means ‘splendour’), EUPHROSYNE also known as EUTHYMIA (glee, merriment, mirth) and THALIAfn6 (cheerfulness). Together they were known as the CHARITES or, to the Romans, the GRATIAE. We call them the Three Graces, favoured throughout history by sculptors and painters seeking an excuse to render perfect female nudes. Their sweetness of nature gave the world something to counteract the horrible malice and cruelty of the Erinyes.

Atlas had been at the centre of every battle, rousing his fellow Titans into combat, shouting for one last supreme effort even as the Hecatonchires were battering them into submission. As punishment for his enmity, Zeus sentenced him to hold up the sky for eternity. This killed two birds with one stone. Zeus’s predecessors, Kronos and Ouranos, had been forced to waste much of their energy in separating heaven from earth. At a stroke Zeus relieved himself of that draining burden and placed it, quite literally, on the shoulders of his most dangerous enemy.

As for Kronos – the dark unhappy soul who had once been Lord of All, the brooding and unnatural tyrant who ate his own children out of fear of prophecy – his punishment, just as his gelded father Ouranos had foretold, was ceaselessly to travel the world, measuring out eternity in inexorable, perpetual and lonely exile. Every day and hour and minute was his to be marked out, for Zeus doomed Kronos to count infinity itself. We can see him everywhere even today, the gaunt sinister figure with his sickle. Now given the cheap and humiliating nickname ‘Old Father Time’, his sallow, drawn features tell us of the inevitable and merciless ticking of Cosmos’s clock, driving all to their end days. The scythe swings and cuts like a remorseless pendulum.

To the victors, the spoils. Like a chief executive who has just completed a hostile takeover, Zeus wanted the old management out and his people in. He allotted each of his siblings their own domain, their areas of divine responsibility. The President of the Immortals chose his cabinet. For himself, he assumed overall command as supreme leader and emperor, lord of the firmament, master of weather and storms: King of the Gods, Sky Father, Cloud-Gatherer. Thunder and lightning were his to command. The eagle and the oak were his emblems, symbols then as now of fierce grace and unopposable might. His word was law, his power formidably great.

Hestia is usually depicted in a plain gown offering up flame in a bowl or sitting on a coarse woollen cushion on a simple wooden throne. It was the custom in Greece to say a grace to her before every meal. The Romans, whose name for her was VESTA, considered her so important that they had a school of priestesses devoted to her, the celebrated Vestal Virgins. Their responsibility, aside from life-long celibacy, was to make sure that the flame representing her was never extinguished. They were the original guardians of the sacred flame.

Under Hades’ personal command came Erebus and Nyx and their son Thanatos (Death himself). A system of river deities, too dark and dreadful to flow in the open air, wound their way through this underworld. The principal was Styx (hate), a daughter of Tethys and Oceanus whose name and ‘stygian’ attributes are invoked to this day whenever we want to describe something dark, menacing and gloomy, something hellishly black and brooding. Into her seeped PHLEGETHON, the flaming river of fire, ACHERON, the river of woe, LETHE, the waters of forgetfulness, and COCYTUS, the stream of lamentation and wailing. Styx’s brother Charon was appointed ferryman, and for the time being he waited, leaning on his pole, by the banks of the Styx. He had dreamed that one day souls by the thousand would come to the shores of the river and pay him the price of transport across. One day soon.

Meliss is still the Greek word for the honeybee, and it is true that its sting is a suicide weapon of last resort.

Wisdom and insight were inherited from her mother, Metis. Handicraft, warcraft and statecraft were hers. Law and justice too. She took a share in what had been uniquely Aphrodite’s domains of love and beauty. Athena’s kind of beauty was expressed in aesthetics, in the apprehension of its ideal in art, representation, thought and character, rather than in the more physical, obvious and perhaps superficial kinds that would always be the business of Aphrodite. The love that Athena stood for had a less heated and physical emphasis too; it was the kind that would later become known as ‘Platonic’.

Mother and daughter cried out with joyful surprise when the boy gave his first choking cries. For the hair on his head was not jet black like his sister’s or mother’s, it was blond – an inheritance from his maternal grandmother, the shining Phoebe. Leto named the child APOLLO. ‘Delian Apollo’, he was sometimes called in honour of his birthplace, and ‘Phoebus Apollo’ in deference to his Titaness grandmother and his own radiant, golden beauty, for Phoebus means ‘shining one’.

Goddess of the chase and the chaste, of the untutored and the untamed, of hounds and hinds, of midwives and the moon, Artemis duly became. The queen of archers and huntresses grew to value her independence and her celibacy above all things. The kindness with which she expressed her sympathy for women in childbirth was countered by the ferocity with which she pursued game and punished any man who presumed to come too near. Feared, admired and adored across the ancient world, she was sometimes known, in honour of the mountainside of her birth, as CYNTHIA. The Romans called her DIANA. Her special tree was the cypress. Inasmuch as Athena was goddess of things cultivated, made, crafted and thought through, Artemis – in her dominion over the natural, instinctive and wild – stood as her opposite.

Apollo was lord of mathematics, reason and logic. Poetry and medicine, knowledge, rhetoric and enlightenment were his realm. In essence he was the god of harmony. The idea that the base material world and its ordinary objects had divine properties and could resonate with the heavens, this was Apollonian, whether expressed in the magical properties of squares, circles and spheres or in the perfect modulation and rhythms of a voice or a chain of reasoning.

To atone for his grievous assault on the proper way of things and to allow the slain Pytho to sleep the eternal sleep of death in the arms of his mother Gaia, Zeus finally fixed the serpent’s resting-place, the island of Delos, to the earth. While it no longer floats free, those who visit the island can testify to this day that it is tough to sail to, being beset by violent Etesian winds and treacherous meltemi currents. Anyone who travels there is likely to suffer the most awful sea-sickness.

What were to be this god’s duties? His fleetness of mind and foot suggested one immediate answer – he should become the messenger of the gods. To make Hermes even faster, Hephaestus fashioned what would become his signature footwear, the talaria – a pair of winged sandals that allowed him to zip from one place to another more swiftly than an eagle. Hermes was so unaffectedly delighted with them, and clasped Hephaestus to him with such warm and grateful affection, that the god of fire and forges immediately limped back to his workshop and, after a day and a night’s furious work, returned with a winged helmet with a low crown and a flexible brim to go with the talaria.

Cadmus is often called ‘the First Hero’. If you care to do the arithmetic you will see that he was a fifth-generation being, of equally human and divine parentage. He could trace his line back to the very beginnings of life through his paternal grandfather Poseidon, whose father was Kronos, son of Ouranos. Through his grandmother Libya he was descended from Inachus, adding a quantity of royal human blood to course through his veins. He had the restlessness and wanderlust that marks the hero, as well as the required measures of courage, confidence and self-belief.

is worth recognizing here that one of the most burdensome challenges faced by the heroes and mortals of that time concerned their relationships with the different gods. Picking your way around the jealousies and animosities of the Olympians was a delicate business. Show too much loyalty and service to one and you risked provoking the enmity of another. If Poseidon and Athena favoured you, as they did Cadmus and Harmonia, for example, then the chances were that Hera, or Artemis, or Ares, or even Zeus himself would do everything possible to hinder and hamper you. And heaven help anyone foolish enough to kill one of their favourites. All the sacrifices and votive offerings in the world couldn’t mollify an affronted god, a vengeful god, a god who had lost face in front of the others.

‘What is the name of this place?’ Cadmus asked. ‘Does anyone here know?’ A voice spoke up, the voice of the man who had warned that the Ismenian Dragon was sacred to Ares. ‘I’m from hereabouts,’ he said. ‘We call this “the plain of Thebes”.’ ‘Then on this plain shall I build a great city. From now on we are not Tyrians, but Thebans’ – a great cheer went up – ‘and these five Spartoi shall be my Theban lords.’

The whisper added that it had been made by Hephaestus. The whisper went further and suggested that Hephaestus had been urged to make it by his wife Aphrodite because she in turn had been urged to do so by her lover Ares, who – if you remember – nursed a grievance against Cadmus for slaying the Ismenian Dragon. For the cruel and shocking truth about the necklace was that it was cursed. Deeply and irrevocably cursed.

The pairing of Cadmus and Harmony seems, like that of Eros and Psyche, to suggest a marriage of two leading and contradictory aspects of ourselves. Perhaps the eastern tradition of conquest, writing and trade represented by Cadmus – his name derives from the old Arabic and Hebrew root qdm, which means ‘of the east’ – can be seen here fusing with love and sensuality to create a new Greece endowed with both.

Once there, Cadmus suddenly fell weary and was filled with an insupportable dread. He called up to the skies. ‘For the last thirty years I have known in my heart that in killing that cursed water snake I killed any chance of happiness for me or my wife. Ares is remorseless. He will not rest until I am as flat on the earth as a snake. If it will calm him and bring more peace to my troubled life then let me end my life sliding through the dust. Let it be so.’

Zeus gazed down at her. The eruption of lust he had felt was all over, but he was surprised to feel the stirrings of something deeper, glowing like embers in his heart.

Above him, around him, inside him, Zeus heard the triumphant laughter of his wife. Of course. He might have known. Somehow Hera had tricked this poor girl into forcing the awful promise from him. Well, she would not get their child. With a peal of thunder Zeus returned to flesh and blood and plucked the foetus from Semele’s belly. It was too young to breathe the air, so Zeus took a knife and sliced open his thigh and tucked the embryo inside. Holding it tight within this makeshift womb Zeus knelt down to sew the child safely into his warm flesh.

Dionysus rushed to the dying youth’s mangled side, but he could not save him.fn9 Instead he caused the dead and twisted body to transform magically into a winding, writhing climbing plant, while the drops of blood solidified and swelled into luscious berries whose skin shone with the bloom and lustre the god had so admired. His lover had become a vine (which is still called ampelos in Greece to this day). From it Dionysus produced the first vintage and drank the first draught of wine. This witchcraft, as it were, of turning the blood of Ampelos into wine became the god’s gift to the world.

By the time he was twenty Asclepius had mastered all the arts of surgery and medicine. He embraced his teacher Chiron in a fond farewell and left to set up on his own as the world’s first physician, apothecary and healer. His fame spread around the Mediterranean with great speed. The sick, lame and unhappy flocked to his surgery, outside which he hung a sign – a wooden staff with a snake twined round it, seen to this day on many ambulances, clinics and (often disreputable) medical websites.fn3 He married EPIONE, whose name means ‘soothing’ or ‘relief from pain’. Together they had three sons and four daughters. Asclepius trained his girls as rigorously as Chiron had trained him. The eldest, HYGIEIA, he taught the practices of cleanliness, diet and physical exercise that are today named ‘hygiene’ after her. To PANACEA he revealed the arts of universal health, of medicinal preparation and the production of remedies and treatments that could heal anything – which is what her name means: ‘cure all’. ACESO he instructed in the healing process itself, including what we would now call immunology.

Tantalus himself was despatched straight to Tartarus and punished in a manner befitting one who dared tempt the gods into feasting on the flesh of the victim of a blood crime. He was placed in a pool of water up to his waist. Above his head waved the bough of a tree from which hung luscious and appetizing fruits. Hunger and thirst raged within him, but every time he stretched up to take a bite, the branch would swing out of his reach. Every time he stooped to drink, the waters of the pool would shrink back to deny him. He could not move away, for above him, threatening to crush him if he dared try to escape, hovered a great stone of the hard glaucus element that would one day be called ‘tantalum’.fn7 There Tantalus stands to this day, agonizingly close to satisfaction, but always denied it, enacting the tortured frustration that bears his name – tantalized, but never satisfied, until the end of time.

But did the boy adore Zeus? That is so hard to know. The ancients believed he did. He is usually represented as smiling and happy. He became a symbol of that particular kind of same-sex love which was to become so central a part of Greek life. His name, it seems, was a kind of deliberate word play, deriving as it did from ganumai ‘gladdening’ and medon ‘prince’ and/or medeon ‘genitals’. ‘Ganymede’, the gladdening prince with the gladdening genitals became twisted over time into the word ‘catamite’. Zeus and Ganymede stayed together as a happy couple for a very long time. Of course the god was as unfaithful to Ganymede as he was to his own wife, but they became almost a fixture nonetheless. When the reign of the gods was coming to an end Zeus rewarded this beautiful youth, his devoted minion, lover and friend, by sending him up into the sky as a constellation in the most important part of the heavens, the Zodiac, where he shines still as Aquarius, the Cupbearer.

The two most celebrated seers of Greek myth were CASSANDRA and TIRESIAS. Cassandra was a Trojan prophetess whose curse was to be entirely accurate in her prognostications yet always just as entirely disbelieved. The Theban Tiresias underwent an equally stressed existence. Born male, he was turned female by Hera as a punishment for striking two mating snakes with a stick, something which annoyed her greatly at the time, for reasons best known to herself. After seven years of serving Hera as a priestess, Tiresias was returned to his original male form, only to be struck blind by Athena for looking on her naked while she bathed in the river.

In the dead hands of Pyramus she sees her own veil, smeared and spattered with blood. She sees the lion’s paw prints and reads all too clearly the story written there. ‘Oh gods, can you have been so jealous of our love that you could not grant us even one short moment of happiness?’ she cries.

As for their spirits – well, Pyramus was turned into the river that bore his name for millennia and Thisbe into a spring whose waters run into it. The flow of the Pyramus (now called the Ceyhan) has been dammed for hydroelectric energy, so the power of the two lovers now goes to light Turkish homes.

The Greeks loved to mythologize the founders of towns and cities. Athena’s gift of the olive to the people of Athens and her raising of Erechtheus (the issue of Hephaestus and the semen-soaked fillet, you will recall) to be the founder of the city seems to have helped foster the Athenian sense of self. The story of Cadmus and the dragon’s teeth did the same for Thebans. Sometimes, as is the case with the founding of the city of Gordium, elements of the story can move from myth to legend to actual, identifiable history.

He did not cause Midas even the slightest amount of pain but just said softly, ‘You honestly think Pan played better than me?’ ‘I do.’ ‘Well, in that case,’ said Apollo, with a laugh, ‘you must have the ears of an ass.’ No sooner were these words out of the god’s mouth than Midas felt something strange and warm and rough going on in his scalp.

That such a figuration is portrayed as swarthy, ugly and hobbling tempts us to interpret and explain. Perhaps we noticed that real blacksmiths, while strong, are often dark, scarred and so muscle-bound as to be bunched and alarming to look upon. Perhaps cultures required that the fit, tall and whole always be taken into the ranks of fighting men and that, from the first, the halt, lame and shorter male children might be trained in the forges and workshops rather than drilled for battle. Any god of blacksmiths that the collective culture imagined, therefore, would be likely to reflect the human archetype they already knew. Gods of this kind are created in our image, not the other way round.

Prayer, ritual and sacrifice, the taxation paid to the invisible forces of nature, those are different things. At some point myth becomes cult becomes religion. It moves from stories told around the fire to a systematized set of beliefs to which obedience is owed. Priestly castes arose who ordained how people should behave. How myths become codified into scriptures, liturgies and theologies is a subject for another book and quite beyond my scope. We can, however, say that the ancient Greeks had no written revealed texts akin to the Bible or the Qur’an. There were ‘mysteries’ and initiations of various kinds that involved ecstatic states, perhaps not unlike the shamanic ones seen today in other parts of the world, and there were plenty of temples and shrines. It is true, as well, that even in the great Athenian age of reason and philosophy a man like Socrates could be executed for religious reasons.

Dionysus and Ares were their gods quite as much as Apollo and Athena. Pan, Priapus and Poseidon too. What makes the Greeks so appealing to us is that they seemed to be so subtly, insightfully and animatedly aware of these different sides to their natures. ‘Know thyself’ was carved into the pronaos of the temple of Apollo at Delphi. As a people – if we read them through the myths as much as in their other writings – they did their best to attend to that ancient maxim.

Towering above them all is the Roman poet ovid (43 bc–ad 17), whose Metamorphoses (Transformations) tells of those mortals, nymphs and others who were changed by the gods into animals, plants, rivers or even stones as a punishment or out of pity. His other works, principally the Ars Amatoria (Art of Love) and Heroides (Heroines) also contain recastings of Greek myth, using always the Latin names for the gods – ‘Jove’ or ‘Jupiter’ for Zeus, ‘Diana’ for Artemis, ‘Cupid’ or ‘Amor’ for Eros. and so on.

Prometheus’s name means, as I have said, ‘forethought’. Forethought has far-reaching implications. Bertrand Russell in his History of Western Philosophy (1945) has this to say: The civilized man is distinguished from the savage mainly by prudence, or, to use a slightly wider term, forethought. He is willing to endure present pains for the sake of future pleasures, even if the future pleasures are rather distant … True forethought only arises when a man does something towards which no impulse urges him, because his reason tells him that he will profit by it at some future date … the individual, having acquired the habit of viewing his life as a whole, increasingly sacrifices his present to his future. This is perhaps a way of suggesting that Prometheus is father of our civilization in a way more subtle than as the provider of fire, whether real or symbolic. Prometheus also bequeathed us this quality of forethought, of being able to act beyond impulse. Was it Promethean forethought that raised us from being from hunter-gatherers to

The complexity and ambiguity of Prometheus is remarkable. He gave us fire, the creative fire, but he also gave us civilizing forethought – which tamped down another, wilder, kind of fire. It is their refusal to see any divine beings as perfect, whole and complete of themselves, whether Zeus, Moros or Prometheus, that makes the Greeks so satisfying.

Others have maintained that Elpis means more than ‘hope’, it suggests expectation and not only that but expectation of the worst. Foreboding, in other words, dread, an impending sense of doom. This interpretation of the Pandora myth submits that the final spirit locked in the jar was in fact the most evil of them all, and that without it man is at least denied a presentiment of the awfulness of his own fate and the meaningless cruelty of existence. With Elpis locked away, in other words, we are, like Epimetheus, capable of living from day to day, blithely ignorant of, or at least ignoring, the shadow of pain, death and ultimate failure that looms over us all.

Nietzsche looked at it in yet another, slightly different way. For him hope was the most pernicious of all the creatures in the jar because hope prolongs the agony of man’s existence. Zeus had included it in the jar because he wanted it to escape and torment mankind every day with the false promise of something good to come. Pandora’s imprisonment of it was a triumphant act that saved us from Zeus’s worst cruelty. With hope, Nietzsche argued, we are foolish enough to believe there is a point to existence, an end and a promise. Without it we can at least try to get on and live free of delusional aspiration.

“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society.” “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.” Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”

“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.” “All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.”

In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.”

how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed on her.

The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.

If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it.” “It is wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.” “Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?” “Yes.

“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure.”

“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.

That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case—was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride—his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane—his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.

Why don’t we have a lunar eclipse every month, when Earth is between the Sun and Moon like this? It is because the Moon’s orbit is tipped at about 5° relative to Earth’s orbit around the Sun. So, in most months, the Moon passes north or south of Earth’s shadow in space, preserving our normal view of the full Moon. Once in a while, when the Moon is full as it crosses the plane of Earth’s orbit, it will pass into Earth’s shadow, and we have lunar eclipse.

Let’s talk about what the force is. Newton’s law of inertia comes in two parts. The first part states that an object that is at rest will remain at rest, unless acted on by an external force. That makes sense. Consider an apple sitting on the table. It has no net force acting on it, and it remains at rest. The second part of Newton’s law of inertia is less intuitive: an object with uniform velocity will remain at that uniform velocity, unless acted on by an external force. Uniform velocity means that it goes at a certain speed and in a certain direction, neither of which change.

Motion at constant speed of 30 km/sec in a circle is not uniform velocity, because the direction of Earth’s motion is constantly changing as it circles the Sun.

Newton found that the force of gravity between the two bodies is proportional to each of their masses, and to the inverse square of the distance r between them (using the reasoning from Kepler’s third law, as just described). “Proportional” here means that the force will involve a constant of proportionality, which we call G, or Newton’s constant, in Sir Isaac’s honor. Here’s Newton’s formula for the force between the Sun and Earth: F = GMSunMEarth/r2 . The force is attractive: the two bodies attract each other, and thus the force is directed from each object toward the other.

Here is another fascinating consequence of Newton’s formula. By Newton’s second law, the force of gravity, which we have just written down, is equal to the mass of Earth (MEarth) times its acceleration, and for circular motion, the acceleration is equal to v2/r. So in this case, F = ma can be rewritten as: GMSunMEarth/r2 = MEarthv2/r . Note that the mass of Earth appears on both sides of this equation, and thus we can divide it out, leaving: GMSun/r2 = v2/r

But that turns out not to be right. Newton realized that you must take into account the gravitational attraction from each and every gram of Earth: not just the piece at our feet, but also those parts on the other side of the globe. It took him about 20 years to figure out how to do this calculation. He needed to add up the forces from every separate chunk of Earth, each at their own distance and direction from this apple. To add up all these forces, he needed to invent a new branch of mathematics, now called integral calculus. The net result of the calculation is that gravity for a spherical object (like Earth) acts as if all its mass were concentrated at its center, a very nonintuitive concept.

Urbain Le Verrier found that this could be explained if Uranus was being pulled by the gravity of another unseen planet farther out from the Sun. He predicted where this planet could be found, and in 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle and Heinrich Louis d’Arrest, using Le Verrier’s calculations, found it only 1° in the sky away from where Le Verrier had predicted it would be. Newton’s laws had been used to discover a new planet: Neptune. Newton’s reputation soared.

Imagine that we scale the Earth–Sun distance down to 1 meter; the Sun itself is then 1 centimeter across. The nearest stars are about 200,000 AU away, so to scale, that is 200 km. The space between stars is enormous compared to their size.

There exists a distance a star can have where the parallax angle is 1 arc second. That distance is called 1 parsec. Is that name cool or what? A parallax angle of 1 second of arc is 1/(360 × 60 × 60) of the circumference of a circle. If the star is at a distance d, the circumference of that circle is C = 2πd. The Earth–Sun distance r = 1 AU subtends 1/(360 × 60 × 60) of that circumference, making 1 AU/2πd = 1/(360 × 60 × 60). Therefore, for a parallax of 1 second of arc, d = 206,265 AU = 1 parsec. It’s all just Euclidean geometry.

In the early days of gods and men, the divine trod the earth with mortals, befriended them, ravished them, coupled with them, punished them, tormented them, transformed them into flowers, trees, birds and bugs and in all ways interacted, intersected, intertwined, interbred, interpenetrated and interfered with us.

Prometheus, whose name means Forethought, has prophesied that now fire is in the world of man, the days of the gods are numbered. Zeus’s rage at his friend’s disobedience derives as much from a deep-buried but persistent fear that man will outgrow the gods as from his deep sense of hurt and betrayal.

But why should the gods need saving? For hundreds of generations a deep resentment has smouldered beneath the earth. When kronos the Titan castrated his father, the primordial sky god ouranos, and hurled his genitals across Greece, a race of giants sprang from where the drops of blood and seed fell. These ‘chthonic’ beings, these creatures sprung from the earth, believe that the time will come when they can wrest power from the arrogant upstart children of Kronos, the Olympian gods. The giants await the day when they can rise up to conquer Olympus and begin their own rule.
