The earliest known coins date back as long ago as 600 BC and were found by archaeologists in the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (near Izmir in modern-day Turkey). These ovular Lydian coins, which were made of the gold-silver alloy known as electrum and bore the image of a lion’s head, were the forerunners of the Athenian tetradrachm, a standardized silver coin with the head of the goddess Athena on one side and an owl (associated with her for its supposed wisdom) on the obverse.

They could export labour and goods, exchanging slaves and timber for silver in Baghdad or for African gold in Cordoba and Cairo. Or they could plunder precious metal by making war on the Muslim world. The Crusades, like the conquests that followed, were as much about overcoming Europe’s monetary shortage as about converting heathens to Christianity.

two of the core definitions of modern monetary theory: M0 (also known as the monetary base or high-powered money), which is equal to the total liabilities of the central bank, that is, cash plus the reserves of private sector banks on deposit at the central bank; and M1 (also known as narrow money), which is equal to cash in circulation plus demand or ‘sight’ deposits. By the time money has been deposited at three different student banks, M0 is equal to $100 but M1 is equal to $271 ($100 + $90 + $81), neatly illustrating, albeit in a highly simplified way, how modern fractional reserve banking allows the creation of credit and hence of money.

Where most plants during photosynthesis create compounds that have three carbon atoms, corn (along with a small handful of other species) make compounds that have four: hence "C-4," the botanical nickname for this gifted group of plants, which wasn't identified until the 1970s. The C-4 trick represents an important economy for a plant, giving it an advantage, especially in areas where water is scarce and temperatures high. In order to gather carbon atoms from the air, a plant has to open its stomata, the microscopic orifices in the leaves through which plants both take in and exhaust gases. Every time a stoma opens to admit carbon dioxide precious molecules of water escape. It's as though every time you opened your mouth to eat you lost a quantity of blood. Ideally, you would open your mouth as seldom as possible, ingesting as much food as you could with every bite. This is essentially what a C-4 plant does. By recruiting extra atoms of carbon during each instance of photosynthesis, the corn plant is able to limit its loss of water and "fix"—that is, take from the atmosphere and link in a useful molecule— significantly more carbon than other plants. At its most basic, the story of life on earth is the competition among species to capture and store as much energy as possible—either directly from the sun, in the case of plants, or, in the case of animals, by eating plants and plant eaters. The energy is stored in the form of carbon molecules and measured in calories. The calories we eat, whether in an ear of corn or a steak, represent packets of energy once captured by a plant. The C-4 trick helps explain the corn plant's success in this competition:

The higher the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 in a person's flesh, the more corn has been in his diet—or in the diet of the animals he or she ate. (As far as we're concerned, it makes little difference whether we consume relatively more or less carbon 13.)

In short, plant and animal domestication meant much more food and hence much denser human populations. The resulting food surpluses, and (in some areas) the animal-based means of transporting those surpluses, were a prerequisite for the development of settled, politically centralized, socially stratified, economically complex, technologically innovative societies. Hence the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia and later, or not at all, on other continents.

AS WE ALREADY noted, the first farmers on each continent could not have chosen farming consciously, because there were no other nearby farmers for them to observe. However, once food production had arisen in one part of a continent, neighboring hunter-gatherers could see the result and make conscious decisions. In some cases the hunter-gatherers adopted the neighboring system of food production virtually as a complete package; in others they chose only certain elements of it; and in still others they rejected food production entirely and remained hunter-gatherers.

Similarly, the concept of cost is far richer (pardon the pun) than the dollars and cents you hand over at the cash register. The real cost of something is what you must give up in order to get it, which is almost always more than just cash. There is nothing “free” about concert tickets if you have to stand in line in the rain for six hours to get them. Taking the bus for $1.50 may not be cheaper than taking a taxi for $7 if you are running late for a meeting with a peevish client who will pull a $50,000 account if you keep her waiting.

So far, the evidence strongly suggests that creating private property rights—giving individual fishermen the right to a certain catch, including the option of selling that right—is the most effective tool in the face of collapsing commercial fisheries. A 2008 study of the world’s commercial fisheries published in Science found that individual transferable quotas can stop or even reverse the collapse of fishing stocks. Fisheries managed with transferable quotas were half as likely to collapse as fisheries that use traditional methods.14

Anyone who tells you that markets left to their own devices will always lead to socially beneficial outcomes is talking utter nonsense. Markets alone fail to make us better off when there is a large gap between the private cost of some activity and the social cost. Reasonable people can and should debate what the appropriate remedy might be. Often it will involve government.

One intriguing and practical middle ground is the notion of “libertarian paternalism,” which was advanced in an influential book called Nudge by Richard Thaler, a professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago, and Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor now serving in the Obama administration. The idea behind benign paternalism is that individuals do make systematic errors of judgment, but society should not force you to change your behavior (that’s the libertarian part); instead, we should merely point you in the right direction (that’s the paternalism part).

One of Thaler and Sunstein’s key insights is that our decisions are often a product of inertia. If our employer automatically signs us up for some kind of insurance coverage, then we’ll stick with that, even if six other plans are offered. Conversely, we may not sign up for any plan at all if it requires some proactive behavior on our part—reading a benefits manual, filling out a form, going to a stupid human resources seminar, or doing anything else that involves time and effort. Thaler and Sunstein propose that inertia (and other decision-making foibles) can be used to some advantage. If policymakers are concerned about some individual behavior, such as inadequate retirement savings, then the libertarian paternalistic option is to make the default option one that automatically puts a decent amount of money from every paycheck into a retirement account. That’s the “nudge.” Anyone is free to choose another option at any time. But a shockingly high proportion of people will stay wherever you put them in the first place.

This idea has profound implications when it comes to something like organ donation. Spain, France, Norway, Israel, and many other countries have “opt-out” (or presumed consent) laws when it comes to organ donation. You are an organ donor unless you indicate otherwise, which you are free to do. (In contrast, the United States has an “opt-in” system, meaning that you are not an organ donor unless you sign up to be one.) Inertia matters, even when it comes to something as serious as organ donation. Economists have found that presumed consent laws have a significant positive effect on organ donation,

Public goods have two salient characteristics. First, the cost of offering the good to additional users—even thousands or millions of people—is very low or even zero. Think of that missile defense system; if I pay to knock terrorist missiles out of the sky, the millions of people who live relatively close to me in the Chicago metropolitan area get that benefit free. The same is true of a radio signal or a lighthouse or a large park; once it is operational for one person, it can serve thousands more at no extra cost. Second, it is very hard, if not impossible, to exclude persons who have not paid for the good from using it. How exactly do you tell a ship’s captain that he can’t use a lighthouse? Do you make him close his eyes as he sails by? (“Attention USS Britannica: You are peeking!”) I once had a professor at Princeton who began his lecture on public goods by saying, “Okay, who are the suckers who actually contribute to public radio?”

Government operations are often described as inefficient. In fact, they operate exactly as we would expect given their incentives. Think about the Department of Motor Vehicles, which has a monopoly on the right to grant driver’s licenses. What is the point of being friendly, staying open longer, making customers comfortable, adding clerks to shorten lines, keeping the office clean, or interrupting a personal call when a customer comes to the window? None of these things will produce even one more customer! Every single person who needs a driver’s license already comes to the DMV and will continue to come

The key to thinking like an economist is recognizing the trade-offs inherent to fiddling with markets. Regulation can disrupt the movement of capital and labor, raise the cost of goods and services, inhibit innovation, and otherwise shackle the economy (such as by letting mosquitoes escape alive). And that is just the regulation inspired by good intentions. At worst, regulation can become a powerful tool for self-interest as firms work the political system to their own benefit. After all, if you can’t beat your competitors, then why not have the government hobble them for you?

On the other hand, economists have asked whether this kind of regulation is less of a “helping hand” for society and more of a “grabbing hand” for corrupt bureaucrats whose opportunities to extort bribes rise along with the number of government permits and licenses required for any endeavor.

economists refer to this kind of inefficiency associated with taxation as “deadweight loss.” It makes you worse off without making anyone else better off. Imagine that a burglar breaks into your home and steals assorted personal possessions; in his haste, he makes off with wads of cash but also a treasured family photo album. There is no deadweight loss associated with the cash he has stolen; every dollar purloined from you makes him better off by a dollar. (Perversely, it is simply a transfer of wealth in the eyes of our amoral economists.) On the other hand, the stolen photo album is pure deadweight loss. It means nothing to the thief, who tosses it in a Dumpster when he realizes what he has taken. Yet it is a tremendous loss to you. Any kind of taxation that discourages productive behavior causes some deadweight loss.

Think about the college example. Sending students to college creates jobs for professors. Using the same money to buy fancy sports cars for high school graduates would create jobs for auto workers. The crucial difference between these scenarios is that a college education makes a young person more productive for the rest of his or her life; a sports car does not. Thus, college tuition is an investment; buying a sports car is consumption (though buying a car for work or business might be considered an investment).

Statistical discrimination, or so-called “rational discrimination,” takes place when an individual makes an inference that is defensible based on broad statistical patterns but (1) is likely to be wrong in the specific case at hand; and (2) has a discriminatory effect on some group. Suppose an employer has no racial prejudice but does have an aversion to hiring workers with a criminal background. That’s certainly a reasonable preference, for all kinds of reasons. If this employer has to make a hiring decision without access to applicants’ criminal backgrounds (either because he doesn’t have the time or resources to gather such information, or perhaps because he is forbidden by law from asking), then it’s entirely plausible that he will discriminate against black male applicants, who are far more likely to have served time in prison (28 percent) than white male applicants (4 percent). Of course, all this employer cares about is whether or not the person standing in front of him has a criminal record. If he can acquire that information with certainty, then the broader social patterns don’t matter. In theory, we would expect access to criminal background checks to reduce discrimination against black men without criminal records. In fact, that is what the data show us.

This was the fundamental insight of 2001 Nobel laureate George Akerlof, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. His paper entitled “The Market for Lemons” used the used-car market to make its central point. Any individual selling a used car knows more about its quality than someone looking to buy it. This creates an adverse selection problem, just as it did with the Hope Scholarships. Car owners who are happy with their vehicles are less likely to sell them. Thus, used-car buyers anticipate hidden problems and demand a discount. But once there is a discount built into the market, owners of high-quality cars become even less likely to sell them—which guarantees the market will be full of lemons. In theory, the market for high-quality used cars will not work, much to the detriment of anyone who may want to buy or sell such a car. (In practice, such markets often do work for reasons explained by the gentlemen with whom Mr. Akerlof shared his Nobel prize; more on that in a moment.)

Now is an appropriate time to dispatch one of the most pernicious notions in public policy: the lump of labor fallacy. This is the mistaken belief that there is a fixed amount of work to be done in the economy, and therefore every new job must come at the expense of a job lost somewhere else. If I am unemployed, the mistaken argument goes, then I will find work only if someone else works less, or not at all. This is how the French government used to believe the world worked, and it is wrong. Jobs are created anytime an individual provides a new good or service, or finds a better (or cheaper) way of providing an old one.

The problem is that everyone else has access to the same information. This is the essence of the efficient markets theory. The main premise of the theory is that asset prices already reflect all available information. Thus it is difficult, if not impossible, to choose stocks that will outperform the market with any degree of consistency. Why can’t you buy a brownstone in Lincoln Park for $250,000? Because buyers and sellers recognize that such a home is worth much more. A share of XYZ Corp. is no different. Stock prices settle at a fair price given everything that we know or can reasonably predict; prices will rise or fall in the future only in response to unanticipated events—things that we cannot know in the present.

Picking stocks is a lot like trying to pick the shortest checkout line at the grocery store. Do some lines move faster than others? Absolutely, just as some stocks outperform others. Are there things that you can look for that signal how fast one line will move relative to another? Yes. You don’t want to be behind the guy with two full shopping carts or the old woman clutching a fistful of coupons. So why is it that we seldom end up in the shortest line at the grocery store (and most professional stock pickers don’t beat the market average)? Because everyone else is looking at the same things we are and acting accordingly. They can see the guy with two shopping carts, the cashier in training at register three, the coupon queen lined up at register six. Everybody at the checkout tries to pick the fastest line. Sometimes you will be right; sometimes you will be wrong. Over time they will average out, so that if you go to the grocery store often enough, you’ll probably spend about the same amount of time waiting in line as everyone else.

Data notwithstanding, the efficient markets theory is obviously not the most popular idea on Wall Street. There is an old joke about two economists walking down the street. One of them sees a $100 bill lying in the street and points it out to his friend. “Is that a $100 bill lying in the gutter?” he asks. “No,” his friend replies. “If it were a $100 bill, someone would have picked it up already.” So they walk on by.

The economic benefits of competition are huge but spread over a large group; the costs tend to be smaller but highly concentrated. As a result, the beneficiaries of creative destruction hardly notice; the losers chain themselves to their congressman’s office door seeking protection, as any of us might if our livelihood or community were at risk.

Doing the right thing—making a decision that generates more benefits for the nation than costs—will not cause people to stand up and cheer. It is far more likely that the many people you have made better off will hardly notice while the small group you have harmed will pelt your car with tomatoes.

The democratic process will always favor small, well-organized groups at the expense of large, diffuse groups. It’s not just how many people care one way or the other; it’s how much they care. Two percent who care deeply about something are a more potent political force than the 98 percent who feel the opposite but aren’t motivated enough to do anything about it.

Green GDP has an obvious logic. The Wall Street Journal explains, “While GDP looks at the market value of goods and services produced in a country each year, it ignores the fact that a nation might be fueling its expansion by polluting or burning through natural resources in an unsustainable way. In fact, the usual methods of calculating GDP make destroying the environment look good for the economy. If an industry pollutes in the process of manufacturing products, and the government pays to clean up the mess, both activities add to GDP.”

The general rule of thumb, based on research done by economist Arthur Okun and known thereafter as Okun’s law, is that GDP growth of 3 percent a year will leave the unemployment rate unchanged. Faster or slower growth will move the unemployment rate up or down by one-half a percentage point for each percentage point change in GDP. Thus, GDP growth of 4 percent would lower unemployment by half a percentage point, and GDP growth of only 2 percent would cause unemployment to rise by half a percentage point. This relationship is not an iron law; rather, it describes the relationship in America between GDP growth and unemployment over the five-decade period studied by Mr. Okun, roughly 1930 to 1980.

the Gini index.* On this scale, a score of zero represents total equality—a state in which every worker earns exactly the same. At the other end, a score of 100 represents total inequality—a state in which all income is earned by one individual. The countries of the world can be arrayed along this continuum. In 2007, the United States had a Gini index of 45, compared to 28 for France, 23 for Sweden, and 57 for Brazil.

Second, there is a finite amount of capital in the world; the more the government borrows, the less that leaves for the rest of us. Large budget deficits can “crowd out” private investment by raising real interest rates. As America’s large budget deficits began to disappear (temporarily) during the 1990s, one profoundly beneficial effect was a fall in long-term real interest rates, making it cheaper for all of us to borrow.

The current account balance, which can be in surplus or deficit, reflects the difference between the income that we earn from the rest of the world and the income that they earn from us. The bulk of that income comes from trade in goods and services. Thus, our balance of trade, which again can be in surplus or deficit, is the largest component of the current account. If we are running a trade deficit with the rest of the world, then we will almost always be running a current account deficit, too. (For the purists, the U.S. current account would also include dividends paid to Americans who own foreign stocks, remittances sent home by Americans working overseas, and other sources of income earned abroad.)

Instead, banks generally borrow from other banks. The second important tool in the Fed’s money supply kit is the federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge other banks for short-term loans. The Fed cannot stipulate the rate at which Wells Fargo lends money to Citigroup. Rather, the FOMC sets a target for the federal funds rate, say 4.5 percent, and then manipulates the money supply to accomplish its objective. If the supply of funds goes up, then banks will have to drop their prices—lower interest rates—to find borrowers for the new funds.

To economists, money is quite distinct from wealth. Wealth consists of all things that have value—houses, cars, commodities, human capital. Money, a tiny subset of that wealth, is merely a medium of exchange, something that facilitates trade and commerce. In theory, money is not even necessary. A simple economy could get along through barter alone.

If a bundle of everyday goods costs $25 in the United States, and a comparable bundle of goods costs 750 rubles in Russia, then we would expect $25 to be worth roughly 750 rubles (and $1 should be worth roughly 30 rubles). This is the theory of purchasing power parity, or PPP. By the same logic, if the value of the ruble is losing 10 percent of its purchasing power within Russia every year while the U.S. dollar is holding its value, we would expect the ruble to lose value relative to the U.S. dollar (or depreciate) at the same rate. This isn’t advanced math; if one currency buys less stuff than it used to, then anyone trading for that currency is going to demand more of it to compensate for the diminished purchasing power.*

Those who oppose more global trade must answer one question, based on a point made by Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs: Is there an example in modern history of a single country successfully developing without trading and integrating with the global economy?14 No, there is not. Which is why Tom Friedman has suggested that the antiglobalization coalition ought to be known as “The Coalition to Keep the World’s Poor People Poor.”

The implicit message of the antiglobalization protests is that we in the developed world somehow know what is best for people in poor countries—where they ought to work and even what kind of restaurants they ought to eat in. As The Economist has noted, “The skeptics distrust governments, politicians, international bureaucrats and markets alike. So they end up appointing themselves as judges, overruling not just governments and markets but also the voluntary preferences of the workers most directly concerned. That seems a great deal to take on.”18

Paul Krugman has nicely summarized the anxiety over globalization with an old French saying: Anyone who is not a socialist before he is thirty has no heart; anyone who is still a socialist after he is thirty has no head. He writes: If you buy a product made in a third-world country, it was produced by workers who are paid incredibly little by Western standards and probably work under awful conditions. Anyone who is not bothered by those facts, at least some of the time, has no heart. But that doesn’t mean the demonstrators are right. On the contrary, anyone who thinks that the answer to world poverty is simple outrage against global trade has no head—or chooses not to use it. The anti-globalization movement already has a remarkable track record of hurting the very people and causes it claims to champion.22

Poor countries can become caught in a human capital trap; if there are few skilled workers, then there is less incentive for others to invest in acquiring skills. Those who do become skilled find that their talents are more valuable in a region or country with a higher proportion of skilled workers, creating the familiar “brain drain.” As World Bank economist William Easterly has written, the result can be a vicious cycle: “If a nation starts out skilled, it gets more skilled. If it starts out unskilled, it stays unskilled.”13

There is something in labor economics called the “backward-bending labor supply curve.” Thankfully, the idea is simpler and more interesting than the name would suggest. Economic theory predicts that as our wages go up, we will work longer hours—up to a point, and then we will begin to work less. Time becomes more important than money. Economists just aren’t quite sure where that curve starts to bend backward, or how sharply it bends.

We often experience a feeling of satisfaction or contentment after eating a fiery meal, and this feeling may be due to endorphins, opiate-like compounds that are produced in the brain as the body’s natural response to pain. This phenomenon may account for some people’s seeming addiction to hot spicy food. The hotter the chili, the more the pain, so the greater the trace amounts of endorphins produced and ultimately the greater the pleasure.

Slipping demand in China and the rest of Asia meant sales dropped by almost a fifth in the region, which accounts for 40% of the company’s worldwide sales. Overall revenues fell by 13% in the quarter, the first such drop since 2003, and net profit was down by a fifth, to $10.5 billion. See article.  Not much to chirp about Investors were once again left disappointed by Twitter’s quarterly earnings. Although the growth in users who access the social-media site at least once a month rose by more than expected, to 310m, it posted another net loss, of $80m, and forecast much lower revenues for the second quarter than analysts had been expecting. Facebook bucked the trend of weak quarterly earnings from tech companies when it reported a 52% jump in revenues, to $5.4 billion, based on the strength of its advertising business on mobile phones. The company also proposed creating a new class of non-voting shares that would allow Mark Zuckerberg to retain long-term control of the company. The Bank of Japan decided not to adjust its policy at its latest meeting, surprising markets which had anticipated another round of stimulus measures in light of reduced forecasts for growth in Japan and the strength of the yen. The currency rose sharply after the decision. At its meeting the Federal Reserve kept its options open about raising interest rates in June, making references to international risks to the US economy without signalling an imminent rate rise. See article.  A court in Munich acquitted Jürgen Fitschen, one of Deutsche Bank’s co-chief executives, on charges of lying under oath in a case related to the collapse of the media empire run by Leo Kirch (who died in 2011). Four other bankers who used to work at Deutsche, including Josef Ackermann, a former chief executive, were also cleared. Mr Fitschen is leaving his job next month when John Cryan takes over as the bank’s sole CEO. Suits booted Two British high-street clothing retailers, Austin Reed and BHS, went into administration. BHS is saddled with £571m ($830m) in pension liabilities, a harbinger of wider issues about underfunded pension schemes at British companies. Its overall debt is £1.3 billion. Around 11,000 workers could lose their jobs. Austin Reed called time after 116 years in business, putting around 1,000 jobs at risk. See article.  BP reported a net loss of $583m for the first quarter. The oil giant was hit with another charge, of almost $1 billion, related to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. It reached an agreement with the federal and state governments last year but the latest settlement is with some local businesses and residents. BP’s cumulative costs associated with the disaster have climbed to almost $56.5 billion. Standard & Poor’s downgraded Exxon Mobil’s credit rating by one notch, the first time the company has not held a triple-A rating since the 1940s. With oil prices averaging $34 a barrel in the first three months of the year, other oil companies have also had their ratings cut in the expectation that they will have to rely less on earnings and more on raising debt to fund their activities. Uber agreed to pay $100m to settle a dispute with its drivers in California and Massachusetts. The settlements mean that Uber’s drivers will still be classified as freelancers. The cases were scheduled to go before a jury to determine if the drivers were employees of the app-based taxi firm, which could have imperilled Uber’s business model. See article.  Volkswagen increased its estimate of the costs it will incur from the emissions-cheating scandal to €16.2 billion ($18.3 billion). The German carmaker booked the charge in its delayed annual earnings, which pushed it to a €5.5 billion net loss for 2015. It has also postponed making public the findings of an internal investigation until it finalises a deal with US regulators. Meanwhile Mitsubishi Motors, Japan’s sixth-largest carmaker, said that orders have halved since its recent admission that employees had falsified fuel-economy tests on some vehicles, a practice which the company now says started as long ago as 1991. Adding to the list of potential wrongdoing in the car industry, Daimler said the US Justice Department had asked it to start an inquiry into its testing of car emissions. Red planet SpaceX announced that it was teaming up with NASA to send an unmanned spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018.

52 Concepts To Add To Your Cognitive Toolkit Concepts change the way we think. Before we knew about evolution, we couldn’t explain much of what was going on around us; for example, how there came to be such a diversity of species on earth. We’ve collated a list of some concepts that have changed the way we think about the world that might be useful additions to your cognitive toolkit. Not all of them are useful – in fact, you’ll find some to be downright useless. People seem to be at different stages in their patterns of thinking: perhaps at your stage #7 will be too obvious or inapplicable, while #26 will be just the idea you need to help answer some problems you’ve been thinking about. We wrote this list because we’re sure us-of-the-past would have appreciated such a list. We hope you do too. We’re always on the hunt for concepts and the like – if any come to mind, please leave them in the comments. There really is so much more to be said on most of these points than we have here. However, we’ve tried to keep things brief, simplifying where necessary, while providing lots of links for those who are interested in reading further. Looking at links will be of particularly high value for this post, as many of these concepts will seem obvious and scarcely worth saying when you simply read their definition. It’s only in seeing their application and how that changes your thinking that you can realise their value. Signalling/ countersignalling – the idea that an action conveys information to someone about the actor. Buying an expensive wedding ring conveys that you don’t think you’re about to run off immediately after the wedding (lest you lose three months of your salary). Countersignalling is when the information you’re trying to signal is so obvious that you need not have signalled in the first place. For instance, Warren Buffett doesn’t need to drive around in a Ferrari to signal how rich he is – everybody already knows that – and not driving around in a Ferrari differentiates him from the plebs that do need to drive one. Note: Buffett still lives in his house in Omaha that cost $31,000 back in 1958, despite being worth billions, but possibly for reasons other than countersignalling. Nudge – the manner in which choices are presented to a target audience can have dramatic effects on their chosen action – even without changing the incentives which might typically motivate an individual to make a given choice. You can install News Feed Eradicator to decrease the likelihood of your future self spending all day scrolling through Facebook. The tax office can write letters saying that 90% of people who work the same job as you have completed their tax return already. Your electricity company can install an electricity meter which constantly reminds you how many watts you’re chewing through at a given time. Male urinals are sometimes made with a small and shoddy picture of a housefly in the centre of them as a target to reduce, err, puddles. Marginal thinking – what are extra resources worth? If you have no bananas, and you get a banana, it’s probably worth more to you than if you already had one million bananas and you get an extra. This is an important concept because it might lead to the realisation that not all the bananas hold the same value to you. Slightly less trivially, what matters with your charitable donation is what happens with that donation, not the average of what the charity achieves. Extra donations to distribute bed nets could do more once there are already the distribution lines established, so it could achieve more. Conversely, it might be already distributing at capacity, and extra donations buy bed nets for $10 instead of $5. Fortunately, the Against Malaria Foundation will still be able to distribute bed nets at exceptional efficiencies, and is a great target for your festive givings. System 1 & System 2 thinking – when we’re making decisions, we use two different systems. System 1 is fast and subconscious, often described as our ‘gut feeling’. It has an edge in social situations or when time is a limiting factor. System 2 is slower and more methodical, better with models and numbers, and deliberate. Comparative vs. absolute advantage – if you are better than me at earning an income from your job and cleaning the house, you have an absolute advantage in both these activities. Does that mean that both of us are better off if you do both? Not necessarily. Suppose you earn $100/hour at work, 10 times more than my $10/hour and further that you clean the house approximately twice as fast as I do. Of these two jobs, I’m ‘least bad’ at cleaning the house, so it might be (depending on the social costs that this arrangement incurs) that both of us would be better off if you paid me $25 an hour to clean your house. Generally, people should do the action that they’re the least bad at, thus working to their comparative advantage. Efficient market hypothesis – there are many people approximately as clever as you who value approximately the same things you do. It’s unlikely you’ll be walking down the street and stumble on $100 000 sitting on the ground which no one else has picked up. In the same way, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to choose a company on the stock market that will do 100 times better than the average company which no one else has already found and invested in (driving the cost of parts of the company (shares) up). This is the same reason why you might have a hard time finding a car park that is (i) free, (ii) right next to work, and (iii) somewhere you can park in all day. Even though such car parks do exist, over time word gets out, and they are occupied in the short term or monetised in the long term. Everything is a market. Thus, when taking the efficient market hypothesis into account, you should 1) look for the things you value in places that other people have systematically failed to look, and 2) think that if something looks too good to be true, it probably is.   Illusion of transparency – we tend to overestimate how much our mental state is known by others, a fact not helped by the ambiguity of the English language. “Elizabeth Newton created a simple test that she regarded as an illustration of the phenomenon. She would tap out a well-known song, such as “Happy Birthday” or the national anthem, with her finger and have the test subject guess the song. People usually estimate that the song will be guessed correctly in about 50 percent of the tests, but only 3 percent pick the correct song. The tapper can hear every note and the lyrics in his or her head; however, the observer, with no access to what the tapper is thinking, only hears a rhythmic tapping.” – Wiki. This phenomenon applies equally well to explanations of novel concepts and the interpretation of emotional states. Opportunity cost – when we choose to take one option, we are implicitly not taking another. If you only have enough room for one meal and your favourite is the Pad Thai, you choose it. But this means you can’t also get the Massaman curry (your second favourite). Economists call this your opportunity cost — your choice minus the benefits of the next best alternative. Opportunity costs are everywhere and form a critical part of decision making. If you’re not donating to the very best charity, you’re not helping others as much as possible. Furthermore, if you don’t spend your time in the best way possible, that is coming at a cost. Cognitive biases – these are systematic flaws in how we think. We don’t look for information that proves us wrong. We estimate that events we can easily recall (perhaps because they happened more recently, or frequently appear in the media) are more likely to occur than they are. We’re overconfident. Particularly relative to our level of expertise. And a whole bunch more. The plot thickens: it’s only our friends and colleagues who are biased. (Author’s caution: don’t become fallacy (wo)man). Heuristics – we use rules of thumb to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty (which turns out to be almost every single decision we make). This is both a blessing and a curse. It’s quicker, useful when we don’t have much information we could deal with explicitly. But also by its nature requires us to make generalisations that might not turn out to be true. It pays to notice that we are using them because they can be wrong. Counterfactual reasoning – what might have happened otherwise? You could push the paramedic out of the way and do the CPR yourself, but you’ll likely do a worse job. So even if you stop the patient from dying, your (counterfactual) impact is likely small, if not negative. Doctors wanting to make a big difference will do more good if they travel to a developing country where their patients might not have received quality healthcare if not for them.  Bayesian reasoning – assigning a probability before an event, receiving evidence, and updating the probability you assigned. This is beneficial insofar as it forces us to think probabilistically. Moreover, it allows us to account for competing evidence and promotes a nuanced view, thus avoiding a simplistic black and white application of ‘good and bad’ outcomes. Expected value – the probability of each outcome multiplied by the value of each outcome. For example, a 50% chance of winning $100 is worth $50 to you, and you should be willing to invest up to $50 for a chance to win (but no more). Applied example: If you have two mutually exclusive ways of helping people, should you take the 10% chance of helping 1 billion people, or the 90% chance at helping 1 million (an equal amount as the billion, and holding all else equal)? Without using expected value, this is a nearly impossible question to evaluate. Time value of money -we’d prefer to have $100 today than tomorrow, or in a year’s time. In a real sense, this implies that money today is worth more than money in the future. This preference comes from the opportunities we have to invest it at (say) 5% interest and gain $5 in that year. How much less you’d be willing to receive now than in a year, is the discount rate (which is 5% in this example). Prisoner’s dilemma/ Tragedy of the commons – a problem in game theory that explains a lot of real world problems. In this situation, there are two players choosing between cooperating and not cooperating. You both do well if you both cooperate. But if you don’t cooperate while the other player tries to cooperate, you do even better. If both of you don’t cooperate then neither of you do well. But if you’re the chump who tries to cooperate while the other player doesn’t, you get screwed worst of all. Examples of this include countries individually benefitting economically from not limiting their carbon emissions, to everyone’s detriment; athletes using performance enhancing drugs to be more individually competitive, when all athletes would be worse off if everyone did it; everyone in society benefits from paying taxes to get roads, but each citizen would rather have the road and not pay taxes herself; etc.. Revealed preferences – talk is cheap, and our actions reveal more about our preferences than we’d like to believe. For instance, although I might say that Marmite is my favourite spread to put on toast, I actually buy Vegemite (#justaustralianthings). As such, my actions reveal what I really prefer. In another example, while Tesla might survey thousands of Australians, of which 60% say they’d pay extra for a greener car, when the car actually becomes available, only 10% follow through with their purchase. Typical mind fallacy – the mistaken belief that others are having the same mental experiences that we are. As the links show, the differences go surprisingly far. Detailed questionnaires have shown that when some people ‘see’ a zebra in their mind’s eye, they’re simply recalling the idea of a zebra, whilst others can count the stripes! The value of your time – You could use your time to earn more money, or do something else that you value. Even if driving to the other side of town saves you $10 on groceries, if it takes you an extra hour, you’re implicitly valuing your free time at $10 per hour. This might be a good deal if you only earn $6 an hour with the company you started after seeing the story of “This One Single Mom Makes $1000 Per Hour – Google HATES Her”. On the other hand if your friend Grace can convert her free time into $50 an hour at work, then for her driving the extra hour is a poor use of time. What’s more, if both Grace and yourself are volunteering alongside each other in a soup kitchen when you’d be happy to work there for $10 an hour, Grace should consider working instead, donating the money she earns, and employing 5 people like you to run the kitchen per hour she is at work. Fundamental attribution error – attributing others’ actions to their personality, but your actions to your situation. You see someone kick the vending machine and assume it must be because they are an angry person. But when you kick the vending machine, it’s because you were hot and thirsty, your boss is an asshole, and the vending machine stole your last goddam dollar. Aumann’s agreement theorem – if two rational agents disagree when they both have exactly the same information, one of them must be wrong. The ‘same information’ qualifier is crucial; very often disagreement is due to differences in information, not failure of rationality. So you should take disagreement seriously if you have reason to believe the other person has significant information that you don’t. Bikeshedding – substituting a hard and important problem for an easy and inconsequential one. When designing a nuclear plant, Parkinson observed that the committee dedicated a disproportionate amount of time to designing the bikeshed – which materials should it be made of, where should it be located etc. These are the kind of questions that everyone is clever enough to contribute to, and where everyone likely wants to have their opinions heard. Unfortunately, these might be discussed at the cost of some of crucial detail, like how to prevent the power plant from killing everyone. Meme – the social equivalent of a gene, except instead of encoding proteins, they represent rituals, behaviours, and ideas. They self-replicate (when they’re passed from one person to another), mutate, and some are selected for in a population – these are the ones that get transmitted. Like selfish genes, the most useful memes don’t necessarily get reproduced. Rather, it is those that are most likely to have a trait that is selected for. Memes are interesting because of the predictions they allow you to make. For instance, there should be few major social movements in society that don’t have the meme “find (or create) other like-minded people to join the movement”. Algernon’s Law – IQ is nearly impossible to improve in healthy people without tradeoffs. If we could get smarter by a simple mechanism, like upregulating acetylcholine, which had no negative side effects (in the ancestral environment), then perhaps evolution would have upregulated acetylcholine already. We could equate this with the ‘efficient market hypothesis’ of improving brain function. Social intuitionism – moral judgements are made predominantly on the basis of intuition, which is followed by rationalisation. For example, slavery was previously a social norm and thought to be acceptable. When asked a question (“is slavery good?”), proponents of slavery introspected an answer (“yes”), and confabulated a reason (“because they’re not actually human” or similar atrocious falsehoods). As this example shows, blind faith in our intuitions can be harmful and counterproductive, because they can be easily corrupted by immoral social norms. It wasn’t just that proponents of slavery got the wrong answer: they had — and we still have —  the wrong process. Apophenia – the natural tendency of humans to see patterns in random noise. E.g. hearing satanic messages when playing songs in reverse. Goodhart’s law/ Campbell’s law – what gets measured, gets managed (and then fails to be a good measure of what it was originally intended for). If we use GDP as a measure of prosperity of a nation, and there are incentives to show that prosperity is increasing, then nations could ‘hack’ this metric. In turn, this may raise GDP while failing to improve the living conditions in the country. Moral licensing – doing less good after you feel like you’ve done some good. After donating to charity in the morning, we’re less likely to hold the door open for someone in the afternoon.  Chesterton’s fence – if you don’t see a purpose for a fence, don’t pull it down, lest you be run over by an angry bull which was behind a tree. If you can’t see the purpose of a social norm, like whether there is any value to having family unit, you shouldn’t ignore it without having thought hard about why it is there.  Asking people who endorse the family unit why it’s important and noticing their reasoning is flawed often isn’t good enough either.  Peltzman effect – taking more risks when you feel more safe. When seatbelts were first introduced, motorists actually drove faster and closer to the car in front of them. Semmelweis reflex – not evaluating evidence on the basis of its merits and instead rejecting it because it contradicts existing norms, beliefs and paradigms. Similar to the status quo bias (which one might choose to combat with the reversal test). Bateman’s principle – the most sexually selective sex will be that which has the most costs from rearing the offspring. In humans, women have more costs associated with raising offspring (maternal mortality, breastfeeding, rearing) and are the more selective sex. In seahorses, the opposite is true: male seahorses carry the offspring in their pouch, and are more selective with those they choose to mate with. Hawthorne effect – people react differently when they know they are being observed. Bulverism – dismissing a claim on the basis of how the opponent got there, rather than a reasoned rebuttal. For example, “but you’re just biased!” or “of course you’d believe that, you’re scared of the alternative.” Flynn effect -IQ has increased by 3 points per decade since around the 1930s. It is hotly debated why this is happening, and whether the trend will continue. Schelling point – a natural point that people will converge upon independently. For instance, if you and I have to meet in Sydney on a particular day, and we don’t know when or where, we might go to where we normally meet, or fall back on meeting at the Opera House at 12PM. This is an important effect in situations where coordination is essential but explicit discussion is difficult.  Furthermore, participants may not even realise it’s happening. For example, “I don’t want to live in a society where genetic enhancement of children increases the gap between the rich and poor. Unfortunately, there’s no clear place at which to say ‘wait, we’re about to reach that society now, let’s stop enhancement!’ Perhaps my comrades and I should instead object against any genetic manipulation at all, including selecting for embryos without cystic fibrosis (even if we wouldn’t mind that particular selection occurring).” Local vs global optima – see the carefully crafted image by yours truly below. In short, you might need to make things worse in order to get to a global optimum – the best possible place to be. If you want to earn more, you might have to sacrifice the number of hours you can work in the short term in order to take a course which will allow you to increase your income in the future. Anthropic principle – you are given a sleeping pill which will wake you up twice if heads, and once if tails. You wake up. What is the chance that today is the day you wake up twice? Similarly, what is the chance that we’re in one of the only universes that is capable of supporting life? Arbitrage – taking advantage of different prices between markets for the same products.

The middle passage refers to the second side of the trade triangle known as the Great Circuit. The first leg of this triangle was the trip from Europe to the coast of Africa, predominantly the west coast of Guinea, bringing manufactured goods to exchange for slaves. The third leg was the passage from the New World back to Europe. The slave ships by that point would have exchanged their human cargo for ore from mines and produce from the plantations, generally rum, cotton, and tobacco. Each leg of the triangle was hugely profitable, especially for Britain: by the end of the eighteenth century the value of British income derived from the West Indies was much greater than the value of income from trade with the rest of the world. Sugar and sugar products, in fact, were the source of the enormous increase in capital and the rapid economic expansion necessary to fuel the British and later the French Industrial Revolution of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | Previous | MS Dhoni’s pythagoras in gloves | The Indian Express | Page 99 Written by Bharat Sundaresan | Updated: May 15, 2016 9:48 am MS Dhoni’s 90 degree leg stretch that has been a feature of his keeping this IPL. No keeper understands the geometry of the cricket field better than MS Dhoni. Bharat Sundaresan joins the dots on how the world’s best stumper has now cut an angle behind the stumps with the outrageously awesome 90 degrees spread of his right foot “AREY, FLUKE tha Sri. Nothing special!” For two years, R Sridhar has had to deal with the same modesty-ridden rhetoric from MS Dhoni. So when India’s fielding coach heard it again after the India-Australia clash in the World T20 in March, he wasn’t really surprised. If anything he was expecting it. But like every other occasion in the past when Dhoni had given him goosebumps by pulling off the wicket-keeping equivalent of a trick-shot for the umpteenth occasion, Sridhar couldn’t help himself from approaching the Indian captain with childlike excitement and an “how the hell did you do that?” expression writ large on his face—only for Dhoni to play it down with unfathomable nonchalance once more. You couldn’t blame Sridhar. What Dhoni had produced earlier that night with the gloves while having David Warner stumped off R Ashwin’s bowling was pretty mind-boggling after all. The off-break had pitched outside the advancing Warner’s leg-stump, thus leaving Dhoni unsighted. By the time it turned sharply past the left-hander’s outside-edge and Dhoni saw it was coming his way the ball was en route to striking the outside part of his left glove and bouncing off it. Realizing his predicament, Dhoni loosened his left hand ever so slightly so that the ball bounced back into his grasp rather than out of it, allowing him to whip the bails off—a phrase that probably was retrospectively coined for him—in his usually rapid fashion. But don’t forget Dhoni had less than a fraction of a second to not only gauge the situation but also adjust accordingly to find a way through it. And he managed it with no fuss. “That is Dhoni’s genius. More than his glove-work, it’s the awareness and intelligence of the sport. He’s always ahead of the eight-ball as a wicket-keeper,” says Sridhar. And he doesn’t mind sounding slightly unctuous while insisting that Dhoni stands nonpareil as a wicket-keeper. “That’s the Mahi way, and it’s one step ahead of the regular wicket-keeping manual,” he adds. *** IT’S this awareness and intelligence that Sridhar credits for Dhoni’s latest eye-catching concoction behind the stumps during the IPL—the one where he looks to illustrate the Pythagoras theorem on the cricket field by raising his right leg at a right angle to stop the ball whenever a right-hander is attempting a fine reverse-sweep or a late dab. In a way, that primordial formula that we all mugged up at some stage of our lives does hold true with this experiment too, especially because he ensures that his gloves remain in their original place. For, by creating the angle that he does with his extended foot, Dhoni does manage to double his reach while having both his hands and legs in perfect positions to stop the ball. Dhoni’s leg-pulling hasn’t gone unnoticed by others. Dinesh Karthik has even tried aping it with some success, after ironically having been one of the early victims of this unique manoeuvre. “Once he did it to me, I thought that it was an idea that could work. If you can do it consistently, you could even have the short third-man wider and cover more space,” explains Karthik. *** IN his dramatic career, Dhoni has proven to be an eponymous hero with the shots he’s played and his captaincy style time and again. While many have at least attempted to wield the willow like him, not many have dared to emulate cricket’s own Pythagoras behind the stumps. And the Mahi way with wicket-keeping gloves in hand has always come with a disclaimer of ‘don’t try this at home, school or work’. Just ask Karthik. “You need to produce ‘give’ so that you can make your hands soft. But he’s able to create that softness even while his hands are going towards the ball, which is amazing. I’ve tried it. It is very hard. I have not been able to get close to that,” says the seasoned Tamil Nadu gloveman. To understand the ‘give’ or the softening effect that Karthik talks about and how that distinguishes Dhoni as being one of a kind, think about catching any hard object thrown towards you with your hands. Be it for a normal person or a professional sportsman who’s not Dhoni, the natural tendency is to push your hands back upon catching it so as to cushion the blow and absorb the force while ensuring that the object doesn’t pop out. It’s physics 101. Where Dhoni is extremely different is his ability to, as Sridhar puts it, ‘use force to absorb force’, by pushing his hands towards the ball even if it might seem like the most unnatural or counter-intuitive motion for any other wicket-keeper. “While others use their hands to produce that give, he uses his wrists. While his hands are going towards the stumps, there’s a slight flick of the wrists in the backward direction. In my opinion, it’s not safe hands but strong hands that allow him to do that. That’s also the reason you will rarely see him collecting the ball to his side like other keepers,” explains Sridhar. It’s like when you are getting off a train and the nearest exit on the platform is behind you. While all others would step out in the direction in which the train’s moving, stop their momentum and then turn around, Dhoni you imagine wouldn’t have to worry about the tiny detour. He could just as well jump straight out against the momentum of the train, and look as unperturbed as ever while doing so. *** IT’S this quiddity with his hands that also makes him arguably the swiftest and most prolific stumper the world’s ever seen — he has pulled off more stumpings than anyone else in history — or as Michael Slater once coined it, ‘the fastest gloves in the west’. Because he doesn’t arch his hands back, precious time is saved by his unique movement forward. To the extent that, according to Sridhar, “It often looks like Dhoni can stop time while executing a stumping.” “Every wicket-keeper would want to get at least 50-60 per cent of the speed at which he pulls off stumpings. He’s made an art out of it. He is the standard bearer. We are all trying to get there,” says Karthik. It’s not only while keeping to spinners that Dhoni has reeled off some of the most breath-taking stumpings of his generation, one of his best-ever came off Irfan Pathan’s bowling in 2007 at Chandigarh when Ricky Ponting’s back heel barely moved out of the crease. According to Sridhar, Dhoni is at least three frames quicker — keeping in mind the 100-odd high-end cameras in use these days — than any wicket-keeper in the world, and the unsuspecting batsman needs to be just one frame short of his crease to be sent on his way by Dhoni. “He uses his peripheral vision more than anybody else. While he’s looking at the ball, his corner of the eye has already gauged where the stumps are and where the batsman’s foot is. Take that stumping off Sabbir Rahman in the World T20 match against Bangladesh. Not only was he quick in collecting the ball down leg and bringing it back but he timed it perfectly just when Rahman’s leg rose from the crease,” explains Sridhar. No wonder then that when you see Dhoni appeal for a run-out or a stumping, it’s inevitable that he’s right. You almost imagine the third-umpire’s job being at risk if Dhoni ever became an on-field umpire, especially when it comes to adjudicating this form of dismissals for it’s unlikely he will ever refer an appeal upstairs. *** It’s not like his glovework has always slipped under the radar, but more like it’s been taken for granted, at times even by his own dressing-room. In his two years as the team’s fielding coach, Sridhar has witnessed Dhoni practice his wicket-keeping drills on three occasions, that’s it. “Those sessions lasted for 5-6 minutes. It was only when he wanted to feel the ball in his gloves or catch a few nicks just to get that feeling going. Nothing flashy,” Sridhar reveals. While it’s with his hands and now even his legs that he tantalizes, it’s his presence of mind and ability to deceive batsmen that dictates the unmatched bravura of Dhoni’s glovework. And it’s not only with the Warner stumping or that unforgettable run-out of Mustafizur Rahman to complete India’s remarkable cricketing escape from Alcatraz against Bangladesh that he’s left Sridhar and the rest of the world in a tizzy. Of late, Dhoni has also rewritten the coaching manual in terms of positioning himself near the stumps for run-outs and being a menace for batsmen approaching his end. Sridhar recalls the time he got David Miller napping last year during the 2015 World Cup at the MCG. After sweeping Ashwin towards Umesh Yadav at deep square leg, the South African left-hander was coming back for a second run, when Yadav flung in a throw that was slightly wide of the stumps. Yet again Dhoni was on hand to realize that his gloves wouldn’t reach the stumps in time to catch Miller short. Instead, he just flicked the ball on to the stumps. In the dug-out, Sridhar and the rest of the support staff were rubbing off goose-bumps. “It’s magic almost at times, and we just wonder how when 100 things must be going through his head, he can come up with such a game-changing play,” says Sridhar. But it’s not always magic from Dhoni. At times, he can turn illusionist too, and mislead the unsuspecting batsman into believing that he’s in no danger. Mitchell Marsh was left hoodwinked recently in an ODI at the MCG again this year. He was running back for a second and as his back was turned, he had no idea which end the throw from mid-off was coming to. His only hint was through looking at Dhoni’s reaction. The Indian captain though simply stood still as if he wasn’t even expecting the throw at his end. But before Marsh could even realize what had happened, Dhoni had collected the throw and knocked the stumps out, leaving the Aussie all-rounder looking like someone whose pocket had been nicked without him even realizing it. “That’s cricket intelligence. If he would have gotten into position earlier, Mitch Marsh would have run faster,” recalls Sridhar, the awe in his voice very evident. *** But Dhoni the wicket-keeper hasn’t been without his flaws, especially when keeping to seam away from home, England in particular. Not only did he often struggle with the late swing in those conditions, he was also guilty of not going for catches that came between him and first-slip, very often not even making an effort to go close to the ball. His bizarre penchant to stand still and see these kind of chances at times apathetically will always stand out as a sore thumb in his otherwise special wicket-keeping career. Sridhar reveals that even in England—and at times when Ishant Sharma was jagging the ball around—Dhoni did try his own unique methods to tackle the late movement. “Dhoni never stops improving or adding new facets to his game. I have seen him take some diving catches off seamers in this IPL, and he did that in last year’s World Cup too,” says Sridhar. But with his Test career well behind him, Dhoni no longer has to worry about the red-ball, Ishant or even a slip-cordon on most occasions. He can now focus purely on leaving many more hapless opposition batsmen and his own dressing-room shaking their heads in disbelief as he continues to defy physics behind the stumps–even as Sridhar and the world try in vain to decipher the science behind Dhoni’s ‘fluky’ experiments. Cunning, street-smart  * In shorter formats, while batsmen are putting pressure on his outfielders, Dhoni is messing with their heads, by not giving away any hints of which end the throw is coming to and banking on his speed of getting the ball to the stumps. * Dhoni’s positioning for run-out opportunities is based on one principle alone—the position he is best placed to get the ball to the stumps in the quickest time. At times though when he believes that the batsman might get in, he changes his mind in the last frame and drops the ball on the stumps to catch him short. * Dhoni has mastered the ability to loosen his hands as per the need of the hour, especially when there’s a lot of turn. Like with David Warner’s dismissal during the World T20, when the ball isn’t heading into the centre of his gloves, he loosens the necessary hand so that the ball bounces back in rather than out. * Dhoni seems to know when a batsman will lift his foot from the crease. If like Sabbir Rahman in the World T20, he does still take chance, Dhoni’s speedy hands does the trick.

And he doesn’t mind sounding slightly unctuous while insisting that Dhoni stands nonpareil as a wicket-keeper. “That’s the Mahi way, and it’s one step ahead of the regular wicket-keeping manual,” he adds. *** IT’S this awareness and intelligence that Sridhar credits for Dhoni’s latest eye-catching concoction behind the stumps during the IPL—the one where he looks to illustrate the Pythagoras theorem on the cricket field by raising his right leg at a right angle to stop the ball whenever a right-hander is attempting a fine reverse-sweep or a late dab. In a way, that primordial formula that we all mugged up at some stage of our lives does hold true with this experiment too, especially because he ensures that his gloves remain in their original place. For, by creating the angle that he does with his extended foot, Dhoni does manage to double his reach while having both his hands and legs in perfect positions to stop the ball. Dhoni’s leg-pulling hasn’t gone unnoticed by others. Dinesh Karthik has even tried aping it with some success, after ironically having been one of the early victims of this unique manoeuvre. “Once he did it to me, I thought that it was an idea that could work. If you can do it consistently, you could even have the short third-man wider and cover more space,” explains Karthik. *** IN his dramatic career, Dhoni has proven to be an eponymous hero with the shots he’s played and his captaincy style time and again. While many have at least attempted to wield the willow like him, not many have dared to emulate cricket’s own Pythagoras behind the stumps. And the Mahi way with wicket-keeping gloves in hand has always come with a disclaimer of ‘don’t try this at home, school or work’. Just ask Karthik. “You need to produce ‘give’ so that you can make your hands soft. But he’s able to create that softness even while his hands are going towards the ball, which is amazing. I’ve tried it. It is very hard. I have not been able to get close to that,” says the seasoned Tamil Nadu gloveman. To understand the ‘give’ or the softening effect that Karthik talks about and how that distinguishes Dhoni as being one of a kind, think about catching any hard object thrown towards you with your hands. Be it for a normal person or a professional sportsman who’s not Dhoni, the natural tendency is to push your hands back upon catching it so as to cushion the blow and absorb the force while ensuring that the object doesn’t pop out. It’s physics 101. Where Dhoni is extremely different is his ability to, as Sridhar puts it, ‘use force to absorb force’, by pushing his hands towards the ball even if it might seem like the most unnatural or counter-intuitive motion for any other wicket-keeper. “While others use their hands to produce that give, he uses his wrists. While his hands are going towards the stumps, there’s a slight flick of the wrists in the backward direction. In my opinion, it’s not safe hands but strong hands that allow him to do that. That’s also the reason you will rarely see him collecting the ball to his side like other keepers,” explains Sridhar. It’s like when you are getting off a train and the nearest exit on the platform is behind you. While all others would step out in the direction in which the train’s moving, stop their momentum and then turn around, Dhoni you imagine wouldn’t have to worry about the tiny detour. He could just as well jump straight out against the momentum of the train, and look as unperturbed as ever while doing so. *** IT’S this quiddity with his hands that also makes him arguably the swiftest and most prolific stumper the world’s ever seen — he has pulled off more stumpings than anyone else in history — or as Michael Slater once coined it, ‘the fastest gloves in the west’. Because he doesn’t arch his hands back, precious time is saved by his unique movement forward. To the extent that, according to Sridhar, “It often looks like Dhoni can stop time while executing a stumping.” “Every wicket-keeper would want to get at least 50-60 per cent of the speed at which he pulls off stumpings. He’s made an art out of it. He is the standard bearer. We are all trying to get there,” says Karthik. It’s not only while keeping to spinners that Dhoni has reeled off some of the most breath-taking stumpings of his generation, one of his best-ever came off Irfan Pathan’s bowling in 2007 at Chandigarh when Ricky Ponting’s back heel barely moved out of the crease. According to Sridhar, Dhoni is at least three frames quicker — keeping in mind the 100-odd high-end cameras in use these days — than any wicket-keeper in the world, and the unsuspecting batsman needs to be just one frame short of his crease to be sent on his way by Dhoni. “He uses his peripheral vision more than anybody else. While he’s looking at the ball, his corner of the eye has already gauged where the stumps are and where the batsman’s foot is. Take that stumping off Sabbir Rahman in the World T20 match against Bangladesh. Not only was he quick in collecting the ball down leg and bringing it back but he timed it perfectly just when Rahman’s leg rose from the crease,” explains Sridhar. No wonder then that when you see Dhoni appeal for a run-out or a stumping, it’s inevitable that he’s right. You almost imagine the third-umpire’s job being at risk if Dhoni ever became an on-field umpire, especially when it comes to adjudicating this form of dismissals for it’s unlikely he will ever refer an appeal upstairs. *** It’s not like his glovework has always slipped under the radar, but more like it’s been taken for granted, at times even by his own dressing-room. In his two years as the team’s fielding coach, Sridhar has witnessed Dhoni practice his wicket-keeping drills on three occasions, that’s it. “Those sessions lasted for 5-6 minutes. It was only when he wanted to feel the ball in his gloves or catch a few nicks just to get that feeling going. Nothing flashy,” Sridhar reveals. While it’s with his hands and now even his legs that he tantalizes, it’s his presence of mind and ability to deceive batsmen that dictates the unmatched bravura of Dhoni’s glovework. And it’s not only with the Warner stumping or that unforgettable run-out of Mustafizur Rahman to complete India’s remarkable cricketing escape from Alcatraz against Bangladesh that he’s left Sridhar and the rest of the world in a tizzy. Of late, Dhoni has also rewritten the coaching manual in terms of positioning himself near the stumps for run-outs and being a menace for batsmen approaching his end. Sridhar recalls the time he got David Miller napping last year during the 2015 World Cup at the MCG. After sweeping Ashwin towards Umesh Yadav at deep square leg, the South African left-hander was coming back for a second run, when Yadav flung in a throw that was slightly wide of the stumps. Yet again Dhoni was on hand to realize that his gloves wouldn’t reach the stumps in time to catch Miller short. Instead, he just flicked the ball on to the stumps. In the dug-out, Sridhar and the rest of the support staff were rubbing off goose-bumps. “It’s magic almost at times, and we just wonder how when 100 things must be going through his head, he can come up with such a game-changing play,” says Sridhar. But it’s not always magic from Dhoni. At times, he can turn illusionist too, and mislead the unsuspecting batsman into believing that he’s in no danger. Mitchell Marsh was left hoodwinked recently in an ODI at the MCG again this year. He was running back for a second and as his back was turned, he had no idea which end the throw from mid-off was coming to. His only hint was through looking at Dhoni’s reaction. The Indian captain though simply stood still as if he wasn’t even expecting the throw at his end. But before Marsh could even realize what had happened, Dhoni had collected the throw and knocked the stumps out, leaving the Aussie all-rounder looking like someone whose pocket had been nicked without him even realizing it. “That’s cricket intelligence. If he would have gotten into position earlier, Mitch Marsh would have run faster,” recalls Sridhar, the awe in his voice very evident. *** But Dhoni the wicket-keeper hasn’t been without his flaws, especially when keeping to seam away from home, England in particular. Not only did he often struggle with the late swing in those conditions, he was also guilty of not going for catches that came between him and first-slip, very often not even making an effort to go close to the ball. His bizarre penchant to stand still and see these kind of chances at times apathetically will always stand out as a sore thumb in his otherwise special wicket-keeping career. Sridhar reveals that even in England—and at times when Ishant Sharma was jagging the ball around—Dhoni did try his own unique methods to tackle the late movement. “Dhoni never stops improving or adding new facets to his game. I have seen him take some diving catches off seamers in this IPL, and he did that in last year’s World Cup too,” says Sridhar. But with his Test career well behind him, Dhoni no longer has to worry about the red-ball, Ishant or even a slip-cordon on most occasions. He can now focus purely on leaving many more hapless opposition batsmen and his own dressing-room shaking their heads in disbelief as he continues to defy physics behind the stumps–even as Sridhar and the world try in vain to decipher the science behind Dhoni’s ‘fluky’ experiments. Cunning, street-smart  * In shorter formats, while batsmen are putting pressure on his outfielders, Dhoni is messing with their heads, by not giving away any hints of which end the throw is coming to and banking on his speed of getting the ball to the stumps. * Dhoni’s positioning for run-out opportunities is based on one principle alone—the position he is best placed to get the ball to the stumps in the quickest time. At times though when he believes that the batsman might get in, he changes his mind in the last frame and drops the ball on the stumps to catch him short. * Dhoni has mastered the ability to loosen his hands as per the need of the hour, especially when there’s a lot of turn. Like with David Warner’s dismissal during the World T20, when the ball isn’t heading into the centre of his gloves, he loosens the necessary hand so that the ball bounces back in rather than out. * Dhoni seems to know when a batsman will lift his foot from the crease. If like Sabbir Rahman in the World T20, he does still take chance, Dhoni’s speedy hands does the trick.

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | Obituary: Lucy Kibaki Cherchez l’autre femme Lucy Kibaki, “Mama Lucy”, Kenya’s First Lady from 2002 to 2013, died on April 26th, aged 82 May 14th 2016 | From the print edition SHE had once been a headmistress, and you could tell. Her lips seemed perpetually pursed in disapproval, and she could chill at a glance. Grown men, from the toughest political operator to the chefs who cooked her husband’s food, quavered in her presence. For when Lucy Kibaki was in a temper, and she often was, there was no telling how things might unfold. The sack, a lash of the tongue, a public snub ostentatiously dealt, a flurry of fists; all were possible, unless you fled out of her way. Her most infamous outburst came late one night in 2005, when she and her bodyguards burst into the offices of the Daily Nation, Kenya’s biggest newspaper. She had clearly been stewing all day over press reports of a visit she had made to a police station in an attempt to have her tenant, the World Bank’s representative, arrested for refusing to turn his music down. Marching around the newsroom, she confiscated pens and notebooks from bewildered night editors, chased one journalist round his desk and then dealt a hefty slap to the face of a cameraman filming the scene. Summoning the Nairobi police chief, she demanded the arrest of the reporter who had written the offending article. That he worked at a different newspaper bothered her not a jot. She was still scolding just before dawn, five hours later. Her voice rising ever higher, she demanded to know how the press could have had the temerity to write that she had gone to the police station in her shorts. It was disrespectful, and anyway, the First Lady had the right to wear whatever she pleased when out and about; even a bikini. Not so female officials at State House, the presidential seat in Nairobi. These were told to wear their hair frumpy and their dresses below the knee. Terrified that her husband Mwai’s eye would wander, Lucy could not tolerate even the most august of female dignitaries if she thought them pretty. The president had to meet Condoleezza Rice, then America’s secretary of state, at an office in the city centre for fear his wife would make a scene. The source of all this angst was plain to see. Her bigamist husband’s second wife, Mary Wambui, persecuted her. She was not so much bothered that there were “three of us” in the marriage, polygamy being common enough in Kenya. It was that her rival was so uppity, and so unbecoming too, with her rural accent and obvious lack of education. Rather than being invisible, as became the junior wife, Mary would flaunt her position, tipping off the press when she was going shopping so that she would be filmed with the state bodyguards and cavalcade of limousines the president had given her. The goad worked. The First Lady could browbeat others; rarely did she get the better of Mary, a politician in her own right and more skilled, devious and ambitious than she was. If that Other Woman was ever placed on the same footing as herself, she would turn into a hellcat. She flounced out of a New Year’s Eve reception after the doddery old vice-president introduced her as the “second lady” and, when the deputy secretary to the cabinet made a similar gaffe at a garden party, she slapped his face and then had him removed by the police. She was a liability to the president, no question. But Mwai always forgave her, for he needed her. After he suffered a car accident and a stroke around the time he took office, she became his gatekeeper, controlling his diary and itinerary and sacking aides who got in her way. With her as chatelaine, State House became stifling and joyless. She shut down the bar where her husband and his powerful coterie of golf-club friends would meet. Her strict Presbyterian upbringing gave her a distaste for alcohol, and the buddies were no help in her battle to keep Mwai sober. Besides, they were much too close to Mary. Lucy aligned herself instead with a faction of corrupt chauvinists from the First Family’s dominant Kikuyu tribe. Unwilling to share power, they were determined to scupper the constitutional reforms Mwai had promised; she helped them largely to spite Mary and those who sided with her. The reforms were shelved, laying the ground for the violence after her husband’s disputed re-election in 2007, when more than 1,000 people were killed. The people’s friend In some ways, though, Lucy was more politically astute than Mwai was. She had the common touch that he, genial but patrician, so patently lacked. He was awful on the stump, and when his ramblings lost the crowd he would turn to her to come to his rescue. On one occasion, fresh from his first presidential victory, he bewilderingly upbraided his constituency supporters as idle drunkards. Taking the microphone, she gently defused the situation, telling her husband that he was wrong: the people before him were hardworking, honest folk. This explained why, for all her flaws, many Kenyans adored her. “I am Lucy, and I will never change,” she said. They did not want her to. She empathised with the poor as no elected politician could. She was passionate about women’s rights in a country where few existed: marry late, she would tell female students, have a career first. To public delight she would berate ministers for their failings, especially if ordinary people suffered as a result. In response Kenyans gave “Mama Lucy” exactly what she wanted: unquestioning respect.

A pupil having asked him should one return good for evil, Confucius replied: “With what then will you recompense kindness? Return good for good, and for evil, justice.” He did not believe that all men were equal; it seemed to him that intelligence was not a universal gift. As his pupil Mencius put it: “That whereby man differs from the lower animals is little. Most people throw it away.” The greatest fortune of a people would be to keep ignorant persons from public office, and secure their wisest men to rule them.

But a civilization is not a material thing, inseparably bound, like an ancient serf, to a given spot of the earth; it is an accumulation of technical knowledge and cultural creation; if these can be passed on to the new seat of economic power the civilization does not die, it merely makes for itself another home. Nothing but beauty and wisdom deserve immortality. To a philosopher it is not indispensable that his native city should endure forever; he will be content if its achievements are handed down, to form some part of the possessions of mankind.

The predictability or unpredictability of their behaviour does not pertain to their precise condition; it pertains to the limited set of their properties with which we interact. This set of properties depends on our specific way of interacting with the teaspoon or the balloon. Probability does not refer to the evolution of matter in itself. It relates to the evolution of those specific quantities we interact with. Once again, the profoundly relational nature of the concepts we use to organize the world emerges.

Compare ‘now’ with ‘here’. ‘Here’ designates the place where a speaker is: for two different people ‘here’ points to two different places. Consequently ‘here’ is a word the meaning of which depends on where it is spoken. The technical term for this kind of utterance is ‘indexical’. ‘Now’ also points to the instant in which the word is uttered, and is also classed as ‘indexical’. But no one would dream of saying that things ‘here’ exist, whereas things which are not ‘here’ do not exist. So then why do we say that things that are ‘now’ exist and that everything else doesn’t? Is the present something which is objective in the world, that ‘flows’ and that makes things ‘exist’ one after the other, or is it only subjective, like ‘here’?

Why Cryonics Makes Sense You’re on an airplane when you hear a loud sound and things start violently shaking. A minute later, the captain comes on the speaker and says: There’s been an explosion in the engine, and the plane is going to crash in 15 minutes. There’s no chance of survival. There is a potential way out—the plane happens to be transferring a shipment of parachutes, and anyone who would like to use one to escape the plane may do so. But I must warn you—the parachutes are experimental and completely untested, with no guarantee to work. We also have no idea what the terrain will be like down below. Please line up in the aisle if you’d like a parachute, and the flight attendants will give you one, show you how to use it and usher you to the emergency exit where you can jump. Those who choose not to take that option, please remain in your seat—this will be over soon, and you will feel no pain. What would you do? When Robert Ettinger was a kid in the 1930s, he read a lot of science fiction, and he assumed that with the world advancing the way it was, scientists would surely have a cure for aging at some point during his lifetime. He would live to see a world where sickness was a thing of the past and death was something people chose to do voluntarily, at a time of their choosing.11← New to WBW? Open these. But thirty years later, aging and involuntary death were still very much a thing, and Ettinger, by then a physics professor, realized that science might not solve these problems in time for him to reap the benefits. So he started thinking about how to hack the system. If, rather than being buried or cremated after his death, he could instead be frozen in some way—then whenever the scientists did eventually get around to conquering mortality, they’d probably also have the tools and know-how to resuscitate him, and he could have the last laugh after all. In 1962, he wrote about this concept in a book called The Prospects of Immortality, and the cryonics movement was born. The first person to give cryonics a try was James Bedford, a psychology professor who died of cancer in 1967 at the age of 73 and is doing his thing in a vat of liquid nitrogen in Arizona as you read this. Others slowly began to follow, and today, there are over 300 people hanging out in vats of liquid nitrogen. Now let’s pause for a second. A year ago, I knew almost nothing about cryonics, and my impressions of it were something like this sentence: Cryonics, or cryogenics, is the morbid process of freezing rich, dead people who can’t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to bring them back to life, and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult. Then I started learning about it. It’s your fault—cryonics is one of the potential-future-post-topics people email me about most, and it’s something at least five readers have brought up in conversation when I’ve met them in person. And as I began to read about cryonics, I soon learned that a lot of the words in my italicized assumption sentence weren’t correct. So let’s work our way through the sentence as we go over exactly what cryonics is and how it works. We’ll start with this part: Cryonics, or cryogenics, is the morbid process of freezing rich, dead people who can’t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to bring them back to life, and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult. It turns out that this is like saying, “Wingsuit flying, or meteorology, is the sport of flying through the air using a wingsuit.” Meteorology is the study of what happens in the atmosphere, which includes how wind works, and wingsuit flying is a process that harnesses the wind—and you’d be an odd person if you thought they were the same thing. Likewise, cryogenics is a branch of physics that studies the production and effects of very low temperatures, while cryonics is the practice of using very low temperatures to try to preserve a human being. Not the same thing. Next, we have a string of three misleading words to talk about: Cryonics is the morbid process of freezing rich, dead people who can’t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to bring them back to life, and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult. We’ll address these three words by going through how cryonics works, starting at the beginning. So you decide you want to be a cryonicist. Here are the steps: Step 1) Pick a company There are four major companies that provide cryonics services—Alcor in Arizona, Cryonics Institute (CI) in Michigan, American Cryonics Society (ACS) in California, and KrioRus in Russia. KrioRus is the newest option and quickly up-and-coming, but the two big boys are Alcor and CI (ACS doesn’t have their own storage facilities—they store with CI). From my perusing, it seems like Alcor is the slightly-more-legit and fancier of the two, while CI (which was started by Robert Ettinger, the guy who launched the movement) is more affordable and gives off more of a mom-and-pop vibe. Both are nonprofit, and each has about 150 people in storage. Alcor has a little over 1,000 “members” (i.e. people who will one day be in storage), and CI has around half that number. Step 2) Become a member To become a cryonicist, you need to fill out some paperwork, sign some stuff and get it notarized, and pay for three things: an annual membership fee, a transport fee to get your body to the facility after you die, and a treatment/storage/revival fee. Alcor’s annual membership fee is about $700, and their transport fee is bundled together with the treatment/storage/revival fee—together they cost $200,000. Alcor gives you the option of ditching your body and just freezing your brain (this is called “neuropreservation”), which brings the price down to $80,000. CI’s annual membership fee is $120 (or a one-time fee of $1,250 for a lifetime membership) and the treatment, etc. costs $35,000 ($28,000 for lifetime members). This is so much cheaper than Alcor for two main reasons: First, it doesn’t include the transport. If you live near the facility, you can save a lot of money. If not, you’ll need to go through their partner for a transport contract, which costs $95,000 ($88,000 for lifetime members). Second, Alcor uses more than half of their large fee to fund what they call their Patient Care Trust. Back in the 70s, there were more cryonics companies, and some of them went bankrupt, which meant their frozen people stopped being frozen, which was a not ideal outcome. Alcor’s trust is a backup fund to make sure their “patients” won’t be affected by something like a company financial crisis. Step 3) Get a life insurance policy in the name of your new cryonics company Sounds shady, right? But it also makes sense. Both Alcor and CI are small companies on a pretty tight budget and neither can afford to offer a payment plan to be hopefully paid out by your estate or your relatives. On the patient end, unless you’re rich, cryonics fees are huge, and a life insurance policy guaranteed to pay your full cryonics fee forces you to save for this fee throughout your life. For young people, even sizable life insurance policies are pretty cheap—with CI, you could be totally covered for as little as $300/year ($120 annual membership, $180 life insurance policy to cover the main fee). Even for Alcor’s more expensive package, costs shouldn’t exceed $100/month. Those fees aren’t nothing, but the whole life insurance thing, at least when it comes to younger people, pretty effectively ejects “rich” from our black and red sentence. If it costs the same as cable or a cigarette habit, you don’t need to be rich to pay for it. Step 4) Put on your bracelet and go on living your life Cryonics members are given a bracelet and a necklace, etched with instructions and contact info, and encouraged to wear one at all times, so if you suddenly die, whoever finds you will know to notify the company. Step 5) Die Okay here’s where things get tricky. We think of the divide between life and death as a distinct boundary, and we believe that at any given point, a person is either definitively alive or definitively dead. But let’s examine that assumption for a second: Let’s first talk about what it means when a person is “doomed” from a health standpoint. We can all agree that what constitutes someone being doomed depends on where, and when, they are. A three-year-old with advanced pneumonia in 1740 would probably have been doomed, while the same child with the same condition today might be fully treatable. The same story could be said of the fate of someone who falls badly ill in a remote village in Malawi compared with their fate if they were in London instead. “Doomed” depends on a number of factors. That the same thing can be said of “dead” is at first pretty unintuitive. But Alcor’s CEO Max More puts it this way: “Fifty years ago if you were walking along the street and someone keeled over in front of you and stopped breathing you would have checked them out and said they were dead and disposed of them. Today we don’t do that, instead we do CPR and all kinds of things. People we thought were dead 50 years ago we now know were not.”2 Today, dead means the heart has been stopped for 4-6 minutes, because that’s how long the brain can go without oxygen before brain death occurs. But Alcor, in its site’s Science FAQ, explains that “the brain ‘dies’ after several minutes without oxygen not because it is immediately destroyed, but because of a cascade of processes that commit it to destruction in the hours that follow restoration of warm blood circulation. Restoring circulation with cool blood instead of warm blood, reopening blocked vessels with high pressure, avoiding excessive oxygenation, and blocking cell death with drugs can prevent this destruction.”3 The site goes on to explain that “with new experimental treatments, more than 10 minutes of warm cardiac arrest can now be survived without brain injury. Future technologies for molecular repair may extend the frontiers of resuscitation beyond 60 minutes or more, making today’s beliefs about when death occurs obsolete.” In other words, what we think of as “dead” actually means “doomed, under the current circumstances.” Someone fifty years ago who suffered from cardiac arrest wasn’t dead, they were doomed to die because the medical technology at the time couldn’t save them. Today, that person wouldn’t be considered dead yet because they wouldn’t be doomed yet. Instead, someone today “dies” 4-6 minutes after cardiac arrest, because that happens to be how long someone can currently go before modern technology can no longer help them. Cryonicists view death not as a singular event, but as a process—one that starts when the heart stops beating and ends later at a point called “the information-theoretic criterion for death”—let’s call it “info death”—when the brain has become so damaged that no amount of present or future technology could restore it to its original state or have any way to retrieve its information. Here’s an interesting way to think about it: Imagine a patient arriving in an ambulance to Hospital A, a typical modern hospital. The patient’s heart stopped 15 minutes before the EMTs arrived and he is immediately pronounced dead at the hospital. What if, though, the doctors at Hospital A learned that Hospital B across the street had developed a radical new technology that could revive a patient anytime within 60 minutes after cardiac arrest with no long-term damage? What would the people at Hospital A do? Of course, they would rush the patient across the street to Hospital B to save him. If Hospital B did save the patient, then by definition the patient wouldn’t actually have been dead in Hospital A, just pronounced dead because Hospital A viewed him as entirely and without exception doomed. What cryonicists suggest is that in many cases where today a patient is pronounced dead, they’re not dead but rather doomed, and that there is a Hospital B that can save the day—but instead of being in a different place, it’s in a different time. It’s in the future. That’s why cryonicists adamantly assert that cryonics does not deal with dead people—it deals with living people who simply need to be transferred to a future hospital to be saved. They believe that in many cases, today’s corpse is tomorrow’s patient (which is why they call their frozen clients “patients” instead of “corpses” or “remains”), and they view their work as essentially “extended emergency medicine.”4 But it’s emergency medicine with an important caveat. Today’s technology has no way to revive a cryonically-suspended patient, so it isn’t considered a medical procedure by the law but rather a weird kind of coffin—i.e. if you cryopreserve someone who hasn’t yet been pronounced dead, it’s seen by the law as homicide. Even if the patient is terminally ill beyond any hope and adamantly doesn’t want to deteriorate further before being cryopreserved, it’s not an option—at least not under current laws (laws that some are trying to change). This puts cryonicists in a tough bind—and it’s exactly where that differing definition of death comes in handy. The law does not see death as a process. For a long time, legal death in the US was considered to occur when a person’s heartbeat and breathing stopped. As modern medical procedures like CPR and defibrillators started to allow those patients to be resuscitated, the law had to change the definition of legal death to include “irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain.”5 The old “heartbeat and breathing” definition of legal death is now called “clinical death,” a middle ground point where there’s an obligation to attempt resuscitation in most cases but where a patient can also have a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order in place (common with terminally ill patients).2 In DNR cases, a doctor or nurse will pronounce a clinically dead patient to be legally dead—even though a resuscitation effort could still revive them. This is a critical fact for cryonics. Cryonics technicians have to wait until legal death to begin their work on a patient, but with the help of a patient’s DNR order, they can start the process right after the heart stops, well before any brain damage sets in. So this is the window for cryonics: Which brings us back to our list, where we can now clarify what we really mean with Step 5: Step 5) Legally Die You legally dying is a key step along the way here, so don’t mess it up. You can do it the good way, the bad way, or the really bad way. The good way: Something predictable where you’re in a cliché deathbed situation, like cancer. This allows you to get yourself on a plane to either Scottsdale (Alcor) or Michigan (CI) and into one of the specifically designated hospice care facilities that the cryonics company regularly works with. This is important because cryonics is highly controversial within the mainstream medical community and often not well-regarded or well-understood. As a result, some hospitals and hospice care facilities are “cryonics friendly” and others are not (those that aren’t have been known to make it difficult for cryonics staff to do what they need to do or deny them the same privileges organ transplant specialists get in a hospital). Once you’re in hospice care, the cryonics company can put staff on standby around the clock, so that the second you legally die, they can be there to start the treatment. The bad way: Something sudden and unexpected, like a heart attack, where at best, someone is there and can contact the cryonics company as you’re rushed to the hospital so they can meet you there, or worse, where you’re dead for a few hours or even longer before anyone finds you. In these circumstances, the cryonics company will do the best they can. Your brain will be in worse shape than ideal when you go into cryopreservation, but again, who knows what future technology will be able to accomplish, and as long as you’re still somewhere in the “cryonics window” and still in the process of dying, not yet having reached info death, there remains hope. The really bad way: A violent accident or something where your brain ends up badly damaged. In the worst of these cases, there’s not much cryonics can do to help—like the Alcor member who died in the September 11th attacks.6 Another bad ending would be dying in a foul-play situation that would lead the police to want to do an autopsy (Alcor suggests its members file a no-autopsy-for-religious-reasons form with the government). A woman who has signed up for cryonics did a Reddit AMA, and when one of the questions was about how signing up had changed her life, she answered, “The biggest change I’ve noticed is that I’m more careful. I drive slower and more cautiously/attentively, I pay more attention to what’s going on around me.” Because she doesn’t want to die the really bad way. Step 6) Cool off ASAP and get transferred to the cryonics facility After you’re declared legally dead, the cryonics team will, ideally, immediately get going. The first thing they do is two-fold—they put you in an ice water bath to bring down your temperature and slow your metabolism (so any damage taking place as a result of cardiac arrest takes longer to happen), and they start getting your heart and lungs working again so that the body remains in stable condition. They do this by administering CPS (like CPR but with an S for support instead of an R for resuscitation, because they’re not trying to resuscitate you) using a mechanical heart-lung resuscitator called a thumper:7 Then they inject you with a number of different medicines to make sure you don’t get blood clots or start rotting. Once that’s under control, they can do a more involved procedure that surgically accesses the major blood vessels in your thigh and hooks them up to this guy:8 That’s a heart-lung machine that takes care of circulation and oxygenation so they can stop the much cruder CPS. In addition to circulating your blood, the machine draws heat out of your body, cooling it to just above the freezing temperature of water, and replaces some of your blood with an organ preservation solution that supports life at super low temperatures (this is similar to how transplant surgeons keep organs alive when they have to transport them long distances). If you have to be flown to the cryonics facility, they pack you in ice and put you on board what they hope is not your last ever flight. Step 7) Get vitrified Most people who know what cryonics is think it means getting frozen. It doesn’t. It means getting vitrified. Glass is weird. It’s not a typical solid because as it cools from its liquid phase, it never crystallizes into an orderly structure. But, as I learned when a bunch of commenters yelled at me after I published this post, it’s not actually a liquid either, since it doesn’t flow. So, it’s neither a typical solid nor a liquid—it’s an “amorphous solid,” sometimes compared to a giant molecule. For our purposes, the key is that like a liquid, glass doesn’t crystallize—rather, as it cools the molecules just move slower and slower until they stop. If you froze a human, all the liquid water in their body would eventually hit its freezing point and crystallize into a solid. That wouldn’t be good—first, water ice takes up about 9% more volume than water liquid, so it would expand and badly damage tissue, and second, the sharp ice crystals would slice through cell membranes and other tissue around it. So to avoid that catastrophic liquid-to-solid state change, cryonics technicians do something cool—they perform surgery through the chest and hook the major arteries up to tubes which pump all the blood out of the body, replacing it with a “cryoprotectant solution,” otherwise known as medical grade anti-freeze. This does two important things: it replaces 60% of the water in the body’s cells, and it lowers the freezing point of what liquid is left. The result, when done perfectly, is that no freezing happens in the body. Instead, as they chill your body down and down over the next three hours, it hits -124ºC, a key point called the “glass transition temperature” when the body’s liquid stays amorphous but rises so high in viscosity that no molecule can budge. You’re officially an amorphous solid, like glass—i.e. you’re vitrified. With no molecule movement, all chemical activity in your body comes to a halt. Biological time is stopped. You’re on pause. Since I’m sure you’re feeling skeptical, it’s helpful to note that vitrifying biological parts is nothing new. We’ve been successfully vitrifying and then rewarming human embryos, sperm, skin, bone, and other body parts for a while now. More recently, scientists vitrified a rabbit kidney:9 Then they rewarmed it and put it back in the rabbit. And it still worked. And just in February of 2016, there was a cryonics breakthrough when for the first time, scientists vitrified a rabbit’s brain and showed that once rewarmed, it was in near-perfect condition, “with the cell membranes, synapses, and intracellular structures intact … [It was] the first time a cryopreservation was provably able to protect everything associated with learning and memory.”10 Once you’re vitrified, you need to keep being chilled, little by little, until after about two weeks, you’re down to -196ºC. Why? Because that’s the point at which nitrogen becomes a liquid, and you’re about to take a long-term liquid nitrogen bath. Step 8) Go into storage Or as Alcor euphemistically calls it, “long-term care.” The new vitrified you now goes into what is essentially a large upright thermos that’s about 10 feet tall and 3.5 feet wide.11 You meet your new neighbors—three other vitrified people, each in their respective quadrant of the thermos, along with five people traveling super lean, with no body, whose heads are stacked in the middle column.12 Or, if you’re in a heads-only thermos, you’ll be one of 45 brains sharing the space (the brain is what’s being stored, but they keep the brains in their heads because it’s riskier to remove a brain than to just keep it in there and use the head as a carrying case). Oh, and you’re upside-down. This is because liquid nitrogen boils off gradually from the top of the container. Normally, it’s no problem—the staff tops it off about once a week. But if, in some worst-case scenario, a container was forced to be left for a long time, the head would be the last thing to be affected—upside-down patients means it would take six months before the nitrogen boiled off so far that the head would be exposed. And when it comes to blackouts, cryonics patients are totally safe—there’s no electricity involved in their storage. And this is where you’ll hang out. Maybe for 10 years. Maybe for 150 years. Maybe for 1,200 years. But the time doesn’t matter to you. You’re on pause. Now’s a good time for us to take a step back and look at the big picture. If Point A is “I’ve decided I want to sign up for cryonics,” and Point B is “Oh cool it’s the year 2482 and here I am doing stuff,” there are four major Ifs that need to all go the right way to take you from A to B: 1) If I legally die in a not really bad way and everything goes as planned with getting me into the thermos and 2) If future humanity ever reaches a point where it has the technology to revive me to full health and 3) If the cryonics company can manage to store me safely and uninterrupted until that point and 4) If when that point comes, the outside world actually does take action to revive me —then I’ll be there in 2482 doing stuff. The eight steps you’ve taken so far that start with choosing a cryonics company and end with you in the thermos only accomplish the first If, with all the other Ifs still standing in between you and the next step in your cryonics journey—revival. To understand how we can reach that step, we need to understand the deal with all four Ifs. We’ll start by talking about Ifs 1-3, which need to be discussed together, because they’re interdependent and they work together. To illustrate why, let’s lay them out in the same visual: The three segments of this line relate to Ifs 1, 2, and 3. But the visual is a little misleading at first, because even though all three segments lie on the same line, they’re all representing different concepts: The blue segment (If 1) represents the quality of your initial preservation. The yellow segment (If 2) represents the capabilities of medical technology as time moves forward. The green segment (If 3) represents the amount of time still needed to bridge the gap between the blue and yellow segments before they can finally connect to each other. The idea is that the better you were preserved, the farther out to the right the blue segment extends, and as technology gets better and better, the yellow segment extends itself farther and farther left toward the blue segment. The green segment gets smaller and smaller as this happens, until eventually the green segment is no more and the blue and yellow segments connect—i.e. medical technology has reached the point where it can revive you. A lot of the key details about cryonics are centered here, so let’s talk about each of these segments in more depth: The blue segment—the quality of your preservation (which relates to If 1) The length of the blue segment corresponds to the quality of preservation. Or, put most simply, the fewer roadblocks there are between your vitrified state in the thermos and a fully restored and healthy you, the longer the blue segment is—because if everything that happens leading up to you being put in the thermos goes as well as possible, it goes a longer way towards getting you to Point B and means the yellow segment has to do less work on its end to be able to revive you. The major factor that determines the length of the blue segment is how closely the atomic structure of your vitrified brain resembles the original atomic structure of your brain when it was living and healthy. Let’s note that I said “brain,” not “body,” because what we mostly care about here is the brain. Cryonicists, like many of us, believe that who you are comes down to your brain. If, in the future, your identical current brain lived on top of a synthetic body and your exact memories and personality were fully intact, cryonicists would be satisfied that you “survived.” That’s why some don’t even bother vitrifying their body. The second thing to note is that scientists believe that short-term memory is contained in brain activity—in the electricity going through your brain—while your long-term memory, your personality, your knowledge, and everything else that makes you “you” is contained in the brain’s structure—i.e. the particular arrangement of atoms that make up your brain.13 Any electrical activity in your brain before legal death will be lost during vitrification, so you’d be revived without the short-term memory of the end of your pre-vitrified life. But what vitrification can preserve is the structure of your brain, which conveniently, is all we care about. This concept gives us a clearer understanding of the way cryonicists view death. To cryonicists, perfect health means the exact arrangement of atoms in your healthy brain being intact, and the process of dying means the deterioration of that arrangement due to phenomena like aging, injury, disease, and, eventually, effects caused by heart stoppage. Death, to them, means the point at which the original structure of your brain has become so disorganized that even the fanciest future science lab would have no way of figuring out what the original arrangement looked like—that’s the definition of info death. The concept of info death makes sense when we compare the brain to a computer’s hard drive. Eliezer Yudkowsky explains how difficult it actually is to bring a computer hard drive to info death:14 If you want to securely erase a hard drive, it’s not as easy as writing it over with zeroes. Sure, an “erased” hard drive like this won’t boot up your computer if you just plug it in again. But if the drive falls into the hands of a specialist with a scanning tunneling microscope, they can tell the difference between “this was a 0, overwritten by a 0” and “this was a 1, overwritten by a 0”. There are programs advertised to “securely erase” hard drives using many overwrites of 0s, 1s, and random data. But if you want to keep the secret on your hard drive secure against all possible future technologies that might ever be developed, then cover it with thermite and set it on fire. It’s the only way to be sure. He applies the same logic to the human brain to suggest that cryonics patients should one day be revivable: Pumping someone full of cryoprotectant and gradually lowering their temperature until they can be stored in liquid nitrogen is not a secure way to erase a person. In other words, it’s reasonable to assume that the fanciest future neuroscientists will become so good at reading a damaged vitrified brain for clues as to its original structure that a typical combo of aging, disease, heart stoppage, and vitrification likely won’t be able to “stump” them. And to cryonicists, if future scientists can examine your vitrified brain and figure out what it’s supposed to look like, you’re not dead—by definition. The length of the blue segment—preservation quality—is affected by three things: 1) How much damage happened before you legally died. How old were you when you died? How much had your brain deteriorated by that point? Did you suffer from a dementia-causing disease like Alzheimer’s and how much permanent damage did that disease do?3 Did the thing that killed you damage your brain (like brain cancer, or a head injury) or was your brain unharmed? 2) How much damage happened between when you legally died and when the cryonics team started working on you. In the ideal situation, your heart stops and before any changes happen in your brain, you’re stabilized and put on ice. Often, this isn’t how things go, and every unattended minute that passes after legal death has a big impact on the brain and shortens the length of the blue segment. But cryonicists believe that true info death doesn’t happen for many hours, or even days, after legal death occurs, and that there’s often hope in cryopreserving even people who lay “dead” for a while before being found. 3) How much damage happened during the vitrifying process. Vitrification itself—at least the way it is currently done—causes its own damage to the brain. Cryonics research focuses mostly on mitigating this factor, and it’s dramatically improved since the earliest days in the 1970s—the series of images at the bottom of this page shows the progress that has been made. The yellow segment—the state of medical technological advancement as time moves forward (which relates to If 2) As medical technology becomes more and more advanced, the yellow segment grows—but while the blue segment extends to the right as it grows, the yellow segment extends to the left. The key point happens when technology eventually gets so good that the yellow segment meets the blue segment and you become officially revivable. Some questions: Will If 2 happen? Will technology ever reach the point when it can revive you? Assuming If 1 gets a check mark, cryonicists believe If 2 is likely to one day get a check mark too. Because there are only two ways to totally fail If 2: 1) For some reason, humans permanently stop working on medical technology advancements before you hit the If 2 key point. 2) Humans go extinct before hitting the If 2 key point. Barring those two situations, If 2 should eventually cooperate. The theory is that with enough future technology, you’ll one day be revivable. When will If 2 happen? How long until I’m revived? This part depends on how substantial the technological challenge of cryonic revival turns out to be and how quickly technology ends up moving forward—but it also depends upon how well If 1 went. As we just discussed, the better If 1 goes, the sooner If 2 happens. How will If 2 happen? What kind of future technology might be able to revive vitrified people? Well, it depends on what we mean by revival. Cryonicists seem to have a Plan A and a Plan B. Plan A: Restore the vitrified patient as a healthy human Under Plan A, revival consists of restoring the structure of the vitrified brain to its original state—i.e. putting all the atoms where they belong. To do that, you need two things: 1) The info about where the atoms are supposed to go 2) A way to put the atoms where they’re supposed to go The first thing is taken care of if today’s vitrifying procedures do their job, assuming future neuroscientists become really good at deciphering a brain’s original state from the information they can gather by examining the vitrified brain. The second thing requires molecular nanotechnology. For a quick nanotech overview, I’ll steal part of a blue box from the AI post: Nanotechnology Blue Box Nanotechnology is our word for technology that deals with the manipulation of matter that’s between 1 and 100 nanometers in size. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, or a millionth of a millimeter, and this 1-100 range encompasses viruses (100 nm across), DNA (10 nm wide), and things as small as large molecules like hemoglobin (5 nm) and medium molecules like glucose (1 nm). If/when we conquer nanotechnology, the next step will be the ability to manipulate individual atoms, which are only one order of magnitude smaller (~.1 nm).4 To understand the challenge of humans trying to manipulate matter in that range, let’s take the same thing on a larger scale. The International Space Station is 268 mi (431 km) above the Earth. If humans were giants so large their heads reached up to the ISS, they’d be about 250,000 times bigger than they are now. If you make the 1nm – 100nm nanotech range 250,000 times bigger, you get .25mm – 2.5cm. So nanotechnology is the equivalent of a human giant as tall as the ISS figuring out how to carefully build intricate objects using materials between the size of a grain of sand and an eyeball. To reach the next level—manipulating individual atoms—the giant would have to carefully position objects that are 1/40th of a millimeter—so small normal-size humans would need a microscope to see them.5 Nanotech was first discussed by Richard Feynman in a 1959 talk, when he explained: “The principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom. It would be, in principle, possible … for a physicist to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down…. How? Put the atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance.” It’s as simple as that. If you can figure out how to move individual molecules or atoms around, you can make literally anything. Nanotechnology so advanced that it allows us to engineer at an atomic level is called molecular nanotechnology (MNT). Humans haven’t yet conquered MNT, and scientists debate how long it’ll take humanity to get there. But when we do, we might look back on today’s technology as terribly primitive, like the picture scientist Ralph Merkle paints: “Today’s manufacturing methods are very crude at the molecular level. Casting, grinding, milling and even lithography move atoms in great thundering statistical herds. It’s like trying to make things out of LEGO blocks with boxing gloves on your hands. Yes, you can push the LEGO blocks into great heaps and pile them up, but you can’t really snap them together the way you’d like.” MNT will be a game-changer in an unimaginable number of arenas, one of which is in medicine. A brain synapse is just a particular configuration of atoms, so if we have the tools to move atoms around and put them where we want, then we can perfectly “repair” a damaged synapse. Cryonicists believe MNT is the key to the future revival and restoration of cryonics patients. The first thought some people have when they think about revival is that the person would be revived as the old and dying person they were before being vitrified. But that’s not the plan. When we get to the point when we have technology so incredible that we can move atoms around well enough to revive someone, we should also have the technology to repair and rejuvenate them. For someone who was dying of cancer before going into the thermos, not only will their successful revival mean that cancer has likely been conquered long ago, but probably aging too. Along the same lines, by that point we should also be able to either rejuvenate the patient’s vitrified body or simply make a new, perfectly-working body. Alcor’s Medical Response Director, Aaron Drake, explains: “We know we can regenerate a small organ, and grow a new heart. We know we can 3-dimensionally print cells and hearts. So at some point we would need to regenerate her entire body, or at least her organs, and put it all together. Then we’d need to transplant that brain into a new body.”15 Plan B: Upload the person’s brain info into a virtual world Plan B shares Plan A’s first requirement—the info about where the atoms are supposed to go—but not its need for physical assembly. Instead, Plan B relies on a hypothetical future technology called “whole brain emulation,” where an entire brain structure can be uploaded to a computer with such perfect accuracy that everything about the person is intact and alive in a virtual world. Sounds super fun, right? This is an option if physical revival is too difficult, or if it’s so far in the future that the physical world has actually gone out of style entirely. If humans can somehow pull off whole brain emulation, you could be revived to wake up in a magical virtual world, fully conscious and no longer confined to the limits and vulnerabilities of biology and the physical world. Please. While both Plan A and B require immense technological hurdles, cryonicists stress that both options are theoretically possible. The green segment—the amount of time you need to stay safely in storage before technology is able to revive you (which relates to If 3) The green segment’s job is simple: hold everything together until the yellow segment connects to the blue segment. So what could mess up If 3? What could sabotage a vitrified person’s ability to remain bathed in liquid nitrogen as long as necessary? A lot of things. Like: The cryonics company screws up. A human-error-caused catastrophe—e.g. a rupture in a thermos tank lets in heat, and all the liquid nitrogen evaporates before the staff realizes what happened. The cryonics company goes bankrupt and doesn’t have the means, the will, or the organization to create a plan that will save the patients. I mentioned that this happened a few times with some of the earlier companies. The major companies today claim to have secure backup plans in place in case of the worst case scenario, and this security blanket is the main purpose of Alcor’s sizable trust. A natural disaster. An earthquake, tornado, or something else smashes the building holding the thermoses to oblivion. Neither major US cryonics company is in a location highly prone to natural disasters—Alcor actually located itself in Scottsdale, AZ because it is the place in the US least at risk of natural disasters. Even if a natural disaster were to strike, the patients might be fine—the thermoses are strong, they’re power-outage-proof with no electricity involved, and even if a thermos is ruptured, there’s the upside-down thing where patients’ heads will be the last body part affected. A terrorist attack on a cryonics facility. There are a lot of people in the world—especially in the world of religion—who hate the concept of cryonics. War. All bets are off in war. The law prevents the cryonics company from doing its job. This one almost happened recently. In 2004, Arizona legislators tried to pass a bill that would have put Alcor under the regulation of the State Funeral Board. This, if passed, would have likely ended up shutting Alcor down. It turned into a nasty debate, centered largely around religious issues, with the religious voice disapproving of Alcor’s line of work—but ultimately, Alcor prevailed. That said, in order to do business legally, Alcor has to accept bodies in the guise of “anatomical donations for research purposes,” a practice protected by the constitutional right to donate one’s body for research into cryopreservation. The law-related variable seems pretty stable currently, but if someone has a long green segment and requires 800 years of storage before their revival becomes possible, who the hell knows what will happen—what is currently Scottsdale, AZ might not even be part of the US by that point. The cryonics company comes under ownership with different values and they decide to give up on the patients. Or, more maliciously, a cryonics-hater makes a too-good-to-refuse offer to the owners of a cryonics company with the intention of shutting it down. All major cryonics companies claim that they’re run and always will be run by passionate cryonicists and this is not a possibility—but again, who knows. The longer the green segment is and the longer it needs to hold out, the higher the chance of failing If 3. If patients can be revived 40 years from now, there’s a lot less that can go wrong than if revival doesn’t become possible for 2,500 years. But the companies are doing their best to plan for the long run. On the question of how long until revival becomes possible, Alcor says, “Some think it will take centuries before patients can be revived, while others think the accelerating pace of technological change might so rapidly transform our world that decades would suffice. Alcor is planning for however long it might take.”16 As time moves forward and both vitrification and revival technology improve, both the blue and yellow segments will tend to move inward, invading the green segment from both sides. The big picture might be best illustrated like this: This is how the blue, green and yellow segments work in flow with each other. Cryonics companies often say cryonics will be a “last in, first out” thing, and this graph shows exactly why— The more time that passes before you need to be vitrified, the fancier the vitrification technology you’ll be treated with and the further along revival technology will be—and this smaller technology gap will mean a sooner revival date. And with less time to have to rely on a cryonics company to care for you, the less risk you’ll be taking. It’s important to understand that the blue line on the graph applies to the average cryonics patient—someone who suffers from Alzheimers late in life will go into vitrification in worse shape than a typical person of their time, so their particular challenge will be greater than the blue line height that corresponds with the year of their death. Of course, the simple, straight lines on the graph are portraying the general concept. The actual lines won’t be straight or predictable. One promising way this might be the case is that the accelerating rate of technological advancement6 might mean that the blue and yellow lines could improve at a faster rate over time and look like this: So that’s how the first three Ifs work. And that’s all great—but none of it matters if If 4 doesn’t pan out. Without If 4—i.e. “Will people actually revive me when the time comes?”—you’re still just a helpless, vitrified body, and if the external world doesn’t keep their side of the bargain once you become revivable, you’re out of luck—and you’ll never know it happened. You’ll be a little like a farm animal. You might have rights in theory, but with no ability to defend your own rights, you’ll rely on other people to fight for those rights on your behalf. As I’ve dug into this topic and talked to people about it, I’ve noticed that this concern seems to jump immediately to people’s minds as a reason cryonics is unlikely to work out. They ask: “There will be enough problems on Earth to deal with—do you really think people are going to care about bringing dead people back to life?” Cryonicists have answers to this question. First, they point out that patients won’t be floating in tanks in a world that has forgotten them. Rather, as a patient, you’d likely have A) descendants or friends who will be highly aware of you and eager to see you reanimated, B) the larger cryonicist community, who will be as passionately interested in your fair treatment as PETA activists are in the fair treatment of animals, and C) the contractual obligation of your future care-takers—similar to how today you might be operated on by a surgeon who doesn’t know you, but who diligently cares for you anyway out of professional obligation. Second, they argue that once the revival of cryonics patients becomes a reality, the public’s conception of what a cryonics patient is and what she deserves will dramatically shift:17 Long before it ever becomes possible to contemplate revival of today’s patients, reversible suspended animation will be perfected as a mainstream medical technology. From that point forward, the whole tradition of caring for people who cannot immediately be fixed will be strongly reinforced in culture and law. By the time it becomes possible to revive patients preserved with the oldest and crudest technologies, revival from states of suspended animation will be something that has been done thousands, if not millions, of times before. The moral and cultural imperative for revival when possible will be as basic and strong as the obligation to render first aid and emergency medical care today. If a cryonics patient might seem to have the rights of a farm animal today, cryonicists expect that to become an outdated and primitive-seeming viewpoint down the road. They believe cryonics patients will be looked upon more like today’s coma patients. That sounds great, but of course, we have no idea how the future will play out or what the standing will be for the field of cryonics and its suspended patients. It does seem plausible, at least, that cryonics patients will end up with more and more rights in the future, not fewer and fewer. If that’s what happens, If 4 shouldn’t be much of a problem. And if all four Ifs go your way, you’ll finally be able to move onto the next step—the one that will really blow your mind when it happens. Step 9) Be revived This will be quite the experience. First, whether it happens 30 years or 2,000 years after you were last conscious, it’ll feel the same to you—probably a bit like a short nap. When you sleep, you feel the passage of time—when you wake up after an eight-hour night’s sleep, it doesn’t feel like you just went to bed a second ago, it feels like it’s been eight hours. But being on pause in your liquid nitrogen thermos is different. You won’t experience the passage of time, so it’ll feel like you were just awake in your previous life (the only reason it won’t feel totally instantaneous is that you’ll have lost your short term memories). You’ll probably be super disoriented, and someone will have to explain to you that A) you’re in the future, and B) the cryonics worked, and you’re no longer a person about to die—you’re healthy and rejuvenated and all set to start living again. How intense. As a very not-heaven-believing person, I’ve always thought about how pleasantly shocked I would be if I died and then woke up in some delightful afterlife. I’d look around, slowly realize what was happening, and then I’d be like, “Wait…NO FUCKING WAY.” Then I’d promptly plant myself at the gates and watch other atheists come in for the fun of seeing them go through the same shock. I imagine being revived from cryonics will be kind of like that. Maybe a few notches less shocking, since you presumably did the cryonics thing because you thought there was a chance it would work—but still a pretty big no fucking way moment. After the initial shock, you’ll have to figure out what kind of world you’ve woken up into. Some possibilities: It could suck. You could wake up in a far future world that’s a lot worse than the one you previously lived in and a world in which you know zero people. Even worse, you could wake up in some really scary situation—who knows what kind of creepy shit might be going on in the future. It could be blah. You could wake up in a world that’s kind of meh. Like it’s not as future-y and cool as you thought it would be and you’re not immortal, just somewhat restored and still vulnerable, and you have to get a job and you don’t really have applicable skills for the times. Just kind of whatevs. It could be incredibly rad. Probably the most likely outcome, you could wake up and it could be very, very rad. The future-y stuff might be cool and fun beyond your comprehension. You might have previously been 84 and aching everywhere and forgetful, and suddenly you have the body of a perfectly fit 20-year-old, or maybe something even better, like a super-charged synthetic body that doesn’t feel pain or exhaustion and can’t get sick. Your old, forgetful brain could be repaired and full of vitality you haven’t experienced in 50 years. And best, you might be surrounded by friends and family who were also cryopreserved and are unbelievably excited to see you. It could be rad. It could be even crazier if you wake up in a virtual world after having had your vitrified brain data uploaded to a computer. You wouldn’t feel like you were in a computer—you’d feel every bit as real as you did when you were a human, except now everything is amazing and magical and you can spend almost all your time fulfilling my lifelong dream of sliding down rainbows like this care bear.18 Your friends and family could be there with you, also virtually uploaded but still fully themselves with all of their old memories—all of you now eternal and indestructible, with no need for the physical world or its resources. Who knows what kind of world you’d wake up in. But a couple things lead me to believe it would be a pretty good situation: A really terrible future world probably isn’t the type of world that would be concerned with protecting and reviving cryonics patients. In a world like that, you’d probably just never wake up. Likewise, a future that can revive vitrified people is by definition pretty technologically amazing, so it’s hard to imagine waking up in a world that hasn’t solved all kinds of problems our current world suffers from. The future tends to be better than the past. Humans have the tendency to predict dystopian futures, but at least so far, it’s been the other way around. Say what you want about the ills of today’s world, but it’s better to be a human today than it was 200 or 1,000 or 10,000 years ago. But because we have no idea what revival will be like, we have this next step: Step 10) Decide if you’re into it and want to stay Barring some hilariously bad scenario where you’re revived into a world of eternal virtual torture with no ability to end it—which really makes no sense—cryonics is a risk-free venture. It has an undo button—just kill yourself and it’s as if it never happened. If you’re not into it, your journey ends here. Otherwise, move on to the next step. Step 11) Enjoy shit We’ve kind of reached the end of me guiding you. You’re now just living again like you were before—hopefully in a much better situation—and what you do at this point is really your business. Just go do your thing and enjoy being in the future. Step 12) Die for real this time At some point, you’ll be over it. No one ever will ever ever want to live forever, a fact I realized at the end of my Graham’s Number post. When the time comes, I assume the fancy future will have some painless way to bow out—something that will cause total info death, where your data is truly unrecoverable. At that point, you’ll have lived the complete life you want to live, not a life cut short by the limitations of the medical technology of the time you happen to be born in. That’s really the way things should be. Now that we all know a lot more about cryonics, let’s bring back our sentence. This is where we were, and we were looking closely at the three words in the red: Cryonics is the morbid process of freezing rich, dead people who can’t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to bring them back to life, and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult. We can get rid of “rich,” because at least for younger people, cryonics can be paid for with a not-that-expensive life insurance plan. We can get rid of “dead,” because cryonics doesn’t deal with dead people, it deals with people currently doomed to die given the technology they have current access to. For the same reason, we can also change the wording of “bring them back to life.” And we can get rid of “freezing,” because cryonics doesn’t freeze people—it vitrifies them into an amorphous solid state. While we’re here, let’s get rid of “morbid.” Is a vitrified human head floating in liquid nitrogen morbid? Yes. Is it more morbid than being eaten by worms and microbes underground or being burned to ashes? Definitely not. So not a fair word to use. So that leaves us with a sentence more like this: Cryonics is the process of pausing people in critical condition who can’t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to save them, and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult. And then there’s the elephant in the room—this part of the sentence: …and the community of hard-core cryonics people might also be a Scientology-like cult. I put that in there because when you’re examining something that involves A) a fringe community, B) the possible concept of immortality, and C) members paying large sums of money for services that they’re told might pan out 1,000 years from now—you have no choice but to put up your “Is this a Scientology-y thing?” antenna. One way to let that antenna do its work is to read a bunch of stuff written by smart, credible people who think the whole thing is utter BS. If anything will disenchant you to the excitement of something as out there as cryonics, it’s experts telling you why it should be ignored. So I did that. And as I read, I weighed what I read against the rebuttal from cryonicists, which I’d often find on Alcor’s highly comprehensive FAQ page. Other resources for the cryonicist viewpoint are the thorough FAQ of the Cryonics Institute’s ex-president, Ben Best, Alcor’s Science FAQ and Alcor’s Myths page. The people who are super not into cryonics fall into a few general buckets: Skeptic Type 1: The scientist with a valid argument about why cryonics might not be possible The mainstream medical community is generally not on board with cryonics. No health insurance company will cover it, no government will subsidize it, no doctors will refer to it as a medical procedure. Some skeptics make what seem to be valid points. Biochemist Ken Storey says, “We have many different organs and we know from research into preserving transplant organs that even if it were possible to successfully cryopreserve them, each would need to be cooled at a different rate and with a different mixture and concentration of cryoprotectants. Even if you only wanted to preserve the brain, it has dozens of different areas, which would need to be cryopreserved using different protocols.” Storey also points out just how tall an order it would be to “repair” someone damaged by vitrification, explaining that “a human cell has around 50,000 proteins and hundreds of millions of fat molecules that make up the membranes. Cryopreservation disrupts all of them.” (Alcor calls this statement patently false.7) Others point to the towering challenge of either repairing a human brain or scanning one in order to upload it. Brazilian scientist Miguel Nicolelis emphasizes that the task of scanning a human brain would require, with today’s technology, “a million electron microscopes running in parallel for ten years.” Michael Hendricks, who studies the brains of roundworms, believes the challenge of reviving the qualities that make someone who they are is far too complex to achieve, explaining that “while it might be theoretically possible to preserve these features in dead tissue, that certainly is not happening now. The technology to do so, let alone the ability to read this information back out of such a specimen, does not yet exist even in principle.” Cryonicist response: Totes Cryonicists don’t really disagree with these people (Storey’s quote notwithstanding). They readily admit that the challenges of reviving someone from cryopreservation are insurmountable using today’s technology. They simply point out that A) there’s no scientific evidence that cryonics can’t work, B) we shouldn’t underestimate what future technology will be able to do (imagine how mind-blowing CRISPR would be to someone in the year 1700 and think about what the equivalent would be for us), and C) there have been some promising developments—like the recent well-preserved vitrified rabbit brain news—that suggest there’s reason for optimism. I’m yet to hear a cryonicist say, “Cryonics will work.” They just don’t feel that this is a case where a lack of proof amounts to a lack of credibility. Alcor’s Science FAQ addresses this: “The burden of proof lies with those who make a claim that is inconsistent with existing well-established scientific theory. Cryonics is not inconsistent with well-established scientific theory … At no point does cryonics require that existing physical law be altered in any way.” Cryonicists also don’t waste an opportunity to point out these quotes: “There is no hope for the fanciful idea of reaching the Moon because of insurmountable barriers to escaping the Earth’s gravity.” — Dr. Forest Ray Moulton, University of Chicago astronomer, 1932. “All this writing about space travel is utter bilge.” — Sir Richard Woolley, Astronomer Royal of Britain, 1956 “To place a man in a multi-stage rocket and project him into the controlling gravitational field of the moon…. I am bold enough to say that such a man-made voyage will never occur regardless of all future advances.” — Dr. Lee De Forest, famous engineer, 1957 Skeptic Type 2: The scientist who argues that cryonics won’t work even though they know less about cryonics than you do right now having read this post This is a surprisingly large category of cryonics skeptics. It’s amazing, for example, how many people from the mainstream medical world argue that cryonics can’t work because when water freezes, it causes irreparable damage to human tissue. Cryonicist response: Agreed—that’s why we don’t freeze people. Please read about what cryonics is before saying more words out of your mouth. Among the cryonics skeptics who literally don’t get what modern cryonics consists of is celebrity physicist Michio Kaku, someone I normally like, but who in this clip is taken to town by Alcor’s CEO for having no idea what he’s talking about. Part of the reason most scientists don’t get cryonics has to do with its cross-disciplinary nature. Alcor explains: Most experts in any single field will say that they know of no evidence that cryonics can work. That’s because cryonics is an interdisciplinary field based on three facts from diverse unrelated sciences. Without all these facts, cryonics seems ridiculous. Unfortunately that makes the number of experts qualified to comment on cryonics very small. For example, very few scientists even know what vitrification is. Fewer still know that vitrification can preserve cell structure of whole organs or whole brains. Even though this use of vitrification has been published, it is so uncommon outside of cryonics that only a handful of cryobiologists know it is possible. Skeptic Type 3: The cryogenicist who doesn’t want the other cool kids to think he’s friends with cryonics, the weird outsider. There’s an amusing little one-way rivalry going on between cryogenicists (who, remember, deal with the science of the effects of cold temperatures in general) and cryonicists. Cryogenicists tend to view cryonics like an astronomer would view astrology—or at least, that’s what they say publicly out of caution. They seem to sometimes admit that there could be sound science behind cryonics, but they also know that cryonics lacks credibility with the wider science community and they don’t want to get roped into that reputation problem by association (they also have very little sense of humor about people confusing the words cryogenics and cryonics). Cryonicist response: Whatevs. Skeptic Type 4: The person who believes that even if you can revive a vitrified person, it won’t really be them. This relates to a philosophical quandary I explored in the post What Makes You You? Are “you” your body? Your brain? The data in your brain? Something less tangible like a soul? This all becomes highly relevant when we’re thinking about cryonics. It’s hard to read about cryonic revival, and especially the prospect of “waking up” in a virtual world you’ve been uploaded into, without asking, “But wait…will that still be me?” This is a common objection to cryonics, but few people will argue with conviction that they know the answer to this question one way or the other. Cryonicist response: Yeah, we’re not sure about that either. Fingers crossed though. Most cryonicists have a hunch that you can survive cryopreservation intact (cryonicist Eliezer Yudkowsky argues that “successful cryonics preserves anything about you that is preserved by going to sleep at night and waking up the next morning”) but they also admit that this is yet another variable they’re not sure about. You might even want to consider this a fifth “If” to add onto our list: If what seems to be a revived me is actually me… Skeptic Type 5: The person who, regardless of whether cryonics can work or not, thinks it’s a bad thing There are lots of these people. A handful of examples: Argument: Cryonics is icky. Typical cryonicist response: Yup, but less icky than decaying underground. Argument: Cryonics is creepy and unnatural. Typical cryonicist response: People said the same thing about the first organ transplants. Argument: Cryonics is trying to play God and cheat death. Typical cryonicist response: Is resuscitating someone whose heart has stopped playing God and cheating death? How about chemotherapy? Argument: Cryonics is a scam. Typical cryonicist response: The major cryonics companies are all nonprofits, the employees are paid modestly and the board members running the company (who are all signed up for cryonics themselves) aren’t paid at all. So who exactly is benefiting from this scam? Argument: “If you have enough money [for cryonics], then you have enough money to help somebody in need today.” — Bioethicist Kenneth Goodman19 Actual cryonicist response: “If you have enough money for health insurance (which costs a lot more than cryonics), then you have enough money to help somebody else in need today. In fact, if you have enough money for any discretionary expenditure (travel, sports, movies, beer), then you have enough money to help somebody in need today. Of all the ways people choose to spend substantial sums of money over a lifetime, singling out the health care choice of cryonics as selfish is completely arbitrary.”20 Argument: “Money invested to preserve human life in the deep freeze is money wasted, the sums involved being large enough to fulfill a punitive function as a self-imposed fine for gullibility and vanity.” — Biologist Jean Medawar21 Actual cryonicist response: “Nobody would ever imagine calling the first recipients of bone marrow transplants or artificial hearts “gullible and vain”. And what of dying children who are cryopreserved? Cryonics is an experiment, and people who choose this experiment are worthy of the same respect as other participants in high risk medical endeavors.”22 Argument: Cryonics will cause an overpopulation disaster. Actual cryonicist response: This is a common one I’ve heard in my discussions. Here’s what Alcor says: “What about antibiotics, vaccinations, statin drugs and the population pressures they bring? It’s silly to single out something as small and speculative as cryonics as a population issue. Life spans will continue increasing in developed parts of the world, cryonics or not, as they have done for the past century. Historically, as societies become more wealthy and long-lived, population takes care of itself. Couples have fewer children at later ages. This is happening in the world right now. The worst population problems are where people are poor and life spans short, not long.”23 Argument: But Ted Williams. Let me explain. There are a handful of famous people signed up for cryonics, like Ray Kurzweil, nanotech pioneer Eric Drexler, and celebrities like Larry King, Britney Spears, Simon Cowell, and Paris Hilton.24 But there are very few big names among the 300 or so who are already vitrified. One that is is baseball legend Ted Williams. Williams is the first thing that comes to mind when a lot of people think about cryonics, an unfortunate fact that cryonicists wish would go away, because his story is mired in scandal (two of Williams’ children said cryonics is what he wanted while the other claimed he wanted to be cremated and the son was just cryopreserving him so he could later profit off of his DNA samples). The ugly story ended up, fairly or unfairly, as a stain on the cryonics industry in many people’s heads, partially because in the midst of it, Sports Illustrated published an article about the scandal with quotes from an ex-Alcor employee accusing Alcor of mismanaging the Williams vitrification, among other things. Typical cryonicist response: Unfairly. It’s a stain unfairly. The accusations weren’t based in reality, and the employee recently admitted in court that what he said may not have been true. Argument: Life is long enough. People aren’t supposed to live longer than we do now. Just enjoy what you’ve got. Typical cryonicist response: Thank you for your opinion. I disagree. So how does my Scientology antenna feel after reading about 50 skeptic opinions? Well, the skeptics definitely helped me appreciate the magnitude of the challenge at hand with cryonics. Science has a long way to go before cryonics can truly function as a pause button instead of a stop button—and we may never get there. But it left me feeling every bit as confident that cryonics is a worthy pursuit and possibly a total game-changer. The fact that cryonic revival seems plausible, coupled with the fact that through most of history, the people of the time couldn’t have even imagined the magic that future technology would make real, makes me feel like the safer bet is on cryonics eventually working. If something important isn’t impossible, the future will probably figure out a way to make it happen, with enough time. There’s also the “why the fuck not?” argument cryonicists make that’s very hard for skeptics to thwart. Pro-cryonics scientist Ralph Merkle says it well:25 The correct scientific answer to the question “Does cryonics work?” is: “The clinical trials are in progress. Come back in a century and we’ll give you an answer based on the outcome.” The relevant question for those of us who don’t expect to live that long is: “Would I rather be in the control group, or the experimental group?” We are forced by circumstances to answer that question without the benefit of knowing the results of the clinical trials. The only way to shoot down a response that says, “We don’t know but we might as well try” is to say, “There is definitely no point in trying because it’s impossible.” And very few credible scientists would claim to have that conviction about things as mysterious as the workings of the brain and the possibilities of the far future. So, for now, cryonics has satisfied my Scientology antenna. Which shortens our sentence to this: Cryonics is the process of pausing people in critical condition who can’t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to save them. The final wording in the sentence that I’d like to challenge is: Cryonics is the process of pausing people in critical condition who can’t accept the concept of death, in the hopes that people from the future will be able to save them. This is the part of the sentence that carries a twinge of eye-rolling contempt—something people often feel when they hear about someone with a desire to conquer mortality. Aside from the aversion we have to the prospect of a human body floating in a freezing tank, many of us feel a distaste towards the motivation behind cryonics. It seems greedy to want more than your one standard life. I’m not one to typically feel contempt at something like this, but early in my research, even I found myself doing a little head shake when I read about billionaire Peter Thiel signing up for cryonics a while back. But this post has forced me to take a big step back—back to where I can see death not as a moment but as a process, back to where I can see the human lifespan as a product of our times, not our biology, and back to where I see the concept of human health spread out along the spans of time and where I can imagine how future humans will see our current times of helplessness in the face of biological deterioration. From way out here, it hits you that we’re living in a phase—a sad little window that an intelligent species inevitably passes through, when they’re advanced enough to understand their own mortality, but still too primitive to save themselves from it. We grapple with this by treating death like a tyrannical overlord we wouldn’t dare try to challenge, not even in our own private thoughts. We’ve been universally defeated and dominated by this overlord for as long as we’ve existed, and all we know how to do is bow down to it in full resignation of its power over us.10 Future humans who have one day overthrown the overlord will look at the phase we’re in and our resulting psychological condition with such clarity—they’ll be sad for us the way we’re sad for brainwashed members of an ancient cult who commit mass suicide because the master has instructed it. Our will isn’t broken when it comes to resisting the overlord—that’s why we see it as honorable to fight cancer till the final minute, heroic to risk your own life for a good cause and make it out alive, and a terrible mistake to resign to the overlord prematurely and commit suicide. But when it comes to defeating the overlord, our will has been squashed by a history that tells us that the overlord is indestructible. And this explains the divide between how cryonicists feel about cryonics and how the rest of us view it. The divide is for two reasons: 1) Cryonicists view death as a process and consider many people who are declared dead today to still be alive—and they view cryonics as an attempted transfer of a living patient to a future hospital that can save his life. In other words, they view cryonics merely as an attempt to resist the overlord, no different than the way we view someone being transferred to a hospital in a different location which has better treatment options for their condition. Most of us, by contrast, view death as a singular moment, so we see cryonics as an attempt to bring a dead person back to life—i.e. we see cryonics as an attempt to defeat the overlord. When cryonicists see us cheer on a billionaire who fights cancer and shake our heads at one who signs up for cryonics, when they see us praying for someone in a coma and rolling our eyes at someone being vitrified—they see us being highly irrational. 2) Cryonicists view death not as an all-powerful overlord but as a puzzle to be solved. They see humans as an arrangement of atoms and see no reason that arrangement should have to inevitably deteriorate if our scientists can just get better at working with atoms. So for them, trying to defeat death altogether is an obvious, rational mission to undertake. But most of us view death as a fundamental fact of the universe—a mysterious and terrifying shadow that hovers over all living things and that only a naive fool would try to escape from—so instead of cheering on the people trying to solve the puzzle of death, we scoff at them and laugh at them, as if they’re too immature to come to peace with the inevitable. Looking at this through a zoomed out lens was a big Whoa Moment epiphany for me. Suddenly, I saw the cryonicists’ of the world in the same light as those rare ancient people trying to understand how earthquakes work so they could be best prepared for the next one, and I realized that when I shook my head at Peter Thiel, I was being like one of the hordes of ancient people who worshipped the gods that had punished us with that earthquake and who wanted to burn those rare scientists at the stake for their blasphemous thinking. I started this post thinking I’d simply write a “mini post” about this little community of cryonicists and what they were trying to do and ended it staring at another example of today’s self-proclaimed science-minded rationalists being tomorrow’s idol-worshippers. I also saw my conception of end-of-life morality flip itself on its head. At the beginning of my research, my question was, “Is cryonics an okay thing to do?” By the end, the question was , “Is it okay to not sign up a dying child for cryonics, or will future people view that the way we see a parent refusing to allow life-saving medical treatment to their child for religious reasons?” Cryonics has quickly come to seem not only like a good thing to try, but like the right thing to do. That’s certainly how Alcor sees it. They say: The moral argument for cryonics is that it’s wrong to discontinue care of an unconscious person when they can still be rescued. This is why people who fall unconscious are taken to hospital by ambulance, why they will be maintained for weeks in intensive care if necessary, and why they will still be cared for even if they don’t fully awaken after that. It is a moral imperative to care for unconscious people as long as there remains reasonable hope for recovery. And once you’re looking through that lens, everything we consider normal starts to look crazy. When Kim Suozzi found out she was dying of cancer at age 23, she signed up to be cryopreserved. She viewed it like trying a new experimental drug that might have a chance to save her when nothing else could—a no-brainer. But her father fiercely resisted the decision,11 Reddit users scorned her for it, and the story was unusual enough to warrant a feature article in the New York Times. It’s as if Kim was part of a group of the world’s cancer-stricken 23-year-olds as they all walked toward a cliff to fall into the jaws of the overlord, and Kim saw a rope hanging from a higher cliff across the chasm and decided to jump for it because maybe, just maybe, it could pull her to safety. And the Times found that to be so bizarre, and so out there, that they wrote a piece on it. Huh? From far away, it looks a lot like we’re all on a plane that’s going down, with our only shot at survival being to take a chance with an experimental parachute—and we’re all just staying in our seats. I’ve decided to take a parachute and jump. I have an appointment set up for early April with a life insurance agent and Alcor member to get set up with a plan. I can boil the decision down to three reasons: 1) I love life. Readers have picked up on my mild obsession with death, which might have something to do with the 55 times I’ve talked about it on this blog. But when they bring it up with me, they refer to it as my fear of death. Which isn’t quite how I feel. It’s more that I really like life. I like doing things and thinking things and I like my family and friends and want to keep hanging out with them if I can. I also really want to see what happens. I want to be there when we figure out the Fermi Paradox and when we discover what dark matter is and when we terraform Mars and when AI takes all our jobs and then extincts all of us. I want to see what the 23rd century is like and see how cool the phones are by then. Being alive is a lot more interesting than being dead. And since I have all of eternity to be dead, it seems logical to stay not dead for at least a while when I have the chance. 2) This chart.  3) Hope. I’ve always been jealous of religious people, because on their deathbed, instead of thinking, “Shit,” they’re thinking, “Okay here’s the big moment—am I about to blink and wake up in heaven??” Much more fun. And much more exciting. Whether cryonics pans out or not, as I age, at least a little part of me can now be thinking, “I wonder what’s gonna happen when I die?” Atheists aren’t supposed to get to think that. Humans don’t need a huge amount of hope to feel hopeful—they just need something to cling onto. Just enough to be able to have the “So you’re sayin there’s a chance!” feeling. Some of you will resonate with my decision—others will think it makes me silly, gullible, or selfish. Either way, you should think about this and the fact that you currently have a plan, whether you realize it or not. Likely, that plan is to resign to death. To walk off the cliff instead of jumping for the lifeline. To stay planted in your seat as the plane goes down. That’s not necessarily the wrong decision, depending on who you are, what you believe, and what you value. But if that’s your plan, it should be because you like that plan more than the alternative—not because you haven’t thought about it and are just doing what everyone else is doing. This is a matter of your one existence, and you have to take the fate of that existence into your own, independent-thinking hands. And if you decide that you probably would rather grab a parachute than stay in your seat, try not to fall victim to a common trap: Cryocrastination. That’s a real term used in the cryonics world to describe the phenomenon of people—especially young people—saying, “Yeah duh I’m obviously doing cryonics when I die” and then not actually going through the actions to sign up and start paying money. It’s natural—what could possibly be easier to procrastinate on? That item on your list—”sign up for cryonics”—tends to never find itself at the top of the to-do list. But no matter what age you are, unexpected things can happen, and if you never got around to signing up when they do, you’re out of luck. If you take a big step back, procrastinating on this is really shortsighted. Just do what I did—book appointments so you’ll actually do it. I hope you’ll do it the same way I’d hope you’d take a shot with an experimental drug if you were sick and it were the one chance you had. Because it’s worth a try. Because it just might work. Because why the fuck not. And because Dylan Thomas said it best: Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

This is a pretty riveting This American Life episode about cryonics. It focuses on the early days of the movement in the ’60s and ’70s, honing in on a notorious cryonics disaster. And here’s a Stuff You Should Know about cryonics. A letter by 60 scientists arguing that cryonics should be taken seriously in the science world. Eliezer Yudkowsky finds a way of popping his head into like a third of the posts I write as I research. He has a bunch of interesting stuff to say about cryonics. Here’s one thing. Here’s another. Two great recent articles about cryonics: One from Motherboard (by Brian Merchant) about a dying two-year-old girl whose parents made her the world’s youngest cryonics patient. And one from the NY Times (by Amy Harmon) that I referenced at the end of the post about a 23-year-old who signed up with Alcor before she died of a brain tumor. An interesting Reddit AMA with a cryonics member. An article from Newsweek (by Anthony Cuthbertson) about the Feb 2016 rabbit-brain-vitrifying breakthrough. I only read excerpts of this, but here’s Robert Ettinger’s famous book that launched the cryonics movement in the early ’60s. An interesting New York Magazine article (by Kerry Howley) that explores the phenomenon of family conflict over cryonics. An Atlantic article (by Rose Eveleth) about the cryonics process. Alcor has a good page on the procedure too. So does CI. Meet Michael Hendricks, a smart scientist who thinks cryonics is horse shit. Here’s another skeptic. And another. Alcor refutes skeptics with this page and this page, and it admits problems with cryonics here. Alcor’s pricing. And CI’s. A video nicely articulating the case for cryonics by Alcor’s CEO Max More.

On Christmas Eve 1968, Apollo 8 passed into the darkness behind the Moon, and Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders became the first humans in history to lose sight of Earth. When they emerged from the Lunar shadow, they saw a crescent Earth rising against the blackness of space and chose to broadcast a creation story to the people of their home planet. A quarter of a million miles from home, lunar module pilot William Anders began: ‘We are now approaching lunar sunrise and, for all the people back on Earth, the crew of Apollo 8 has a message that we would like to send to you. In the beginning God created the heaven and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.’

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | Previous | China’s Curious South China Sea Negotiation Policy | The Diplomat What would China expect to achieve with bilateral negotiations on maritime disputes? By David A. Welch for The Diplomat June 24, 2016 There has been a great deal of commentary recently on Beijing’s strident refusal to participate in the Philippines’ arbitration case and the almost desperate vehemence with which it is preparing to greet the tribunal’s final judgment. This is not terribly surprising, as most analysts agree that the Philippines will win on a number of crucial points, undercutting some, if not all, of China’s maritime claims. However, there has been surprisingly little analysis of Beijing’s preferred alternative to adjudicated dispute resolution: namely, bilateral negotiations. How might we understand this? What does it tell us about China’s wants, needs, or fears? What does it say about Chinese leaders’ view of the world? The bilateral negotiation option is particularly puzzling in view of China’s profession that it has had “indisputable sovereignty” in the South China Sea since “ancient times.” One doesn’t make arguments about history at a negotiating table: one makes offers. Negotiation is the art of finding a quid pro quo, not winning a debate. And if Chinese sovereignty is indisputable, what is there to negotiate about? Is Beijing willing to give some up? If, as most analysts believe, the regime is as petrified of rising nationalist sentiment as it appears to be (this seems, after all, to be one of the main reasons that Beijing has been trying to undermine the Philippines arbitration case), then how could it possibly cede ground at a negotiating table without triggering a domestic backlash? The cynical interpretation is that China wants to negotiate bilaterally so that it can bully others into submission. But it would be strange indeed if Beijing really thought that Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, or Brunei would be willing to sit down at a negotiating table merely to accept surrender terms. Presumably, Beijing thinks there must be a contract zone of some kind. What might that be? Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month. One possibility is that Beijing is willing to resolve the lingering ambiguity of its South China Sea claims in order to settle disputes. The concession here, presumably, would be clarity. Beijing might say, for instance—as Taiwan has said—that the so-called nine-dash line is only meant to encompass the islands over which China claims sovereignty, not the body of water over which it claims maritime jurisdiction. That, China might say, would be governed by UNCLOS rules. The upside of this concession for rival claimants would be that it would pave the way for an orderly demarcation of territorial seas, exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and continental shelf rights. The downside for rival claimants would be that unless China were actually willing to concede sovereignty over some of the Spratly, Paracel, or Pratas islands to others, the gain in clarity would largely be meaningless. China would still be asserting maritime jurisdiction over most of the South China Sea. Moreover, a great irony of this scenario is that the Philippines arbitration tribunal, whose legitimacy China has so hotly rejected, will certainly clarify a number of the provisions of UNCLOS, on the basis of which those maritime entitlements would be determined. If this is China’s default bargaining position, it would appear to be dead on arrival. More likely, Beijing may think that rival claimants may be willing to yield on symbols in return for material gains. A strong indication that this may be so is that Beijing has regularly held out the prospect of “joint development” of natural resources in the South China Sea. Conceivably, Beijing may think that rival claimants would be willing to acknowledge China’s sovereignty over disputed islands in return for access to fishing grounds and the prospect of oil and gas riches. Certainly this would be an attractive outcome for China’s leaders, as they would be able to represent it domestically as standing ground on the “core interest” of sovereignty while at the same time demonstrating paternal benevolence toward China’s smaller and weaker neighbors. If this is the hand Beijing is prepared to play, it would tell us at least three interesting and important things: first, that for China the South China Sea dispute is fundamentally about symbols, respect, and prestige; second, that Chinese leaders do not believe that rival claimants similarly care about symbols, respect, and prestige; and third, that Chinese leaders believe that rival claimants think they can trust China to share in the South China Sea’s resource bounty equitably and reliably. The first of these is eminently plausible. But the latter two are not. People in general tend to care about symbols, respect, and prestige, and it would betray a naïve view of human psychology to think that Chinese do and others do not. Quite apart from the fact that China’s neighbors have feared, resented, and often resisted its “paternal benevolence” for thousands of years, China’s recent behavior has gravely damaged its reputation for trustworthiness—not only in the South China Sea, but also, for example, in Hong Kong. If Chinese leaders think there is a contract zone here, they lack the empathy required to see that this is wishful thinking. At the end of the day, Beijing faces a stark choice if it truly wishes to settle disputes in the South China Sea: it can either put its confidence in its claims to the test in appropriate judicial fora, or it can offer rival claimants genuinely attractive terms, which would almost certainly require territorial concessions. At present, both seem highly unlikely. Meanwhile, tensions continue to rise. Fasten your seatbelts. David A.

things will minimise their potential energy if they can find a way of doing so. So, you could answer the question ‘why does a ball roll down a hill?’ by saying that the ball would have lower gravitational potential energy at the bottom of the hill than the top, so it rolls down. You could also, of course, say that there is a force pulling the ball down the hill. Physicists often work with energies rather than forces, and the two languages are interchangeable.

With a collapsing cloud of dust, the shape that ultimately forms will therefore be the shape that minimises the gravitational potential energy. The shape must be the one that allows everything within the cloud to get as close to the centre of it as it possibly can, because anything that is located further away from the centre will have more gravitational potential energy! So, the shape that ensures that everything is as close to the centre as possible is, naturally, a sphere, which is why stars and planets are spherical

1967, when physicists Freeman Dyson and Andrew Lenard showed that the stability of matter is down to a quantum mechanical effect called the Pauli exclusion principle. There are two types of particles in nature, which are distinguished by a property known as spin. The fundamental matter particles, such as electrons and quarks, and composite particles, such as protons and neutrons, have half-integer spin; these are known collectively as fermions. The fundamental force carrying particles such as photons have integer spin; these are known as bosons. Fermions have the important property that no two of them can occupy the same quantum state. Put more simply, but slightly less accurately, this means you can’t pile lots and lots of them into the same place. This is the reason why atoms are stable and chemistry happens. Electrons occupy distinct shells around the atomic nucleus, and as you add more and more electrons, they go into orbits further and further away from the nucleus. It is only the behaviour of the outermost electrons that determine the chemical properties of an element. Without the exclusion principle, all the electrons would crowd into the lowest possible orbit and there would be no complex chemical reactions and therefore no people.

If you try to press atoms together you force their electron clouds together until at some point you are asking all the electrons to occupy the same place (it is more correct to say the same quantum state). This is forbidden, and leads to an effective force that prevents you squashing the atoms together any further. This force is called electron degeneracy pressure,

Boltzmann’s definition of entropy is essentially a mathematical description of the difference between a sandcastle and a sand pile. It says that the entropy of something is the number of ways in which you can rearrange its constituent parts and not notice that you’ve done so. For a sandcastle, the number of ways in which you can arrange the grains and still keep the highly-ordered shape of the castle is quite low, so it therefore has low entropy. For a sand pile, on the other hand, pretty much anything you do to it will still result in there being a pile of sand in the desert, indistinguishable from any other pile of sand. The sand pile therefore has a higher entropy than the sandcastle, simply because there are many more ways of arranging the grains of sand such that they form a pile of sand than arranging them into a castle. Boltzmann wrote this down in a simple equation, which is written on his gravestone: S is the entropy, W is the number of ways in which you can arrange the component bits of something such that it is not changed, and kB is a number known as Boltzmann’s constant.

things will get more messy or disordered simply because there are more ways of being disordered than ordered. This means that there is a difference between the past and the future: the past was more ordered and the future will be less ordered, because this is the most likely way for things to play out. This is what Eddington meant by his statement that the future is more random than the past, and his description of the arrow of time as the thing that points in the direction of increasing randomness. And this is why entropy always increases.

Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star – the most common type of star in our universe. Red dwarfs are diminutive and cold, with surface temperatures in the region of 4,000K, but they do have one advantage over their more luminous and magnificent stellar brethren: because they’re so small, they burn their nuclear fuel extremely slowly, and consequently they have life spans of trillions of years. This means that stars like Proxima Centauri will be the last living stars in the Universe.

(Brewster 1860, p. 331)

THE COURSE OF a scientific discipline gets shaped in different ways, depending on whether theories lead data or data lead theories. A theory tells you what to look for, and you either find it or you don’t. If you find it, you move on to the next open question. If you have no theory but you wield tools of measurement, you’ll start collecting as much data as you can and hope that patterns emerge. But until you arrive at an overview, you’re mostly poking around in the dark.

Curiously, Ceres alone accounts for about a quarter of the total asteroidal mass. And if you add up the masses of all the asteroids big enough to see, plus all the smaller asteroids whose existence can be extrapolated from the data, you don’t get anywhere near a planet’s worth of mass. You get about 5 percent the mass of Earth’s moon.

Centrifugal forces arise as the simple consequence of an object’s tendency to travel in a straight line after being set in motion, and so are not true forces at all. But you can calculate with them as though they are. When you do, as did the brilliant eighteenth-century French mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813), you discover spots in the rotating Earth-Moon system where the gravity of Earth, the gravity of the Moon, and the centrifugal forces of the rotating system balance. These special locations are known as the points of Lagrange. And there are five of them. The first point of Lagrange (affectionately called L1) falls between Earth and the Moon, slightly closer to Earth than the point of pure gravitational balance. Any object placed there can orbit the Earth-Moon center of gravity with the same monthly period as the Moon and will appear to be locked in place along the Earth-Moon line. Although all forces cancel there, this first Lagrangian point is a precarious equilibrium. If the object drifts sideways in any direction, the combined effect of the three forces will return it to its former position. But if the object drifts directly toward or away from Earth, ever so slightly, it will irreversibly fall either toward Earth or the Moon, like a barely balanced marble atop a steep hill, a hair’s-width away from rolling down one side or the other. The second and third Lagrangian points (L2 and L3) also lie on the Earth-Moon line, but this time L2 lies far beyond the far side of the Moon, while L3 lies far beyond Earth in the opposite direction. Once again, the three forces—Earth’s gravity, the Moon’s gravity, and the centrifugal force of the rotating system—cancel in concert. And once again, an object placed in either spot can orbit the Earth-Moon center of gravity with the same monthly period as the Moon. The gravitational hilltops represented by L2 and L3 are much broader than the one represented at L1. So if you find yourself drifting down to Earth or the Moon, only a tiny investment in fuel will bring you right back to where you were. While L1, L2, and L3 are respectable space places, the award for best Lagrangian points must go to L4 and L5. One of them lives far off to the left of the Earth-Moon centerline while the other is far off to the right, each representing a vertex of an equilateral triangle, with Earth and Moon serving as the other vertices. At L4 and L5, as with their first three siblings, all forces balance. But unlike the other Lagrangian points, which enjoy only unstable equilibrium, the equilibria at L4 and L5 are stable; no matter which direction you lean, no matter which direction you drift, the forces prevent you from leaning farther, as though you were in a valley surrounded by hills. For each of the Lagrangian points, if your object is not located exactly where all forces cancel, then its position will oscillate around the point of balance in paths called librations. (Not to be confused with the particular spots on Earth’s surface where one’s mind oscillates from ingested libations.) These librations are equivalent to the back-and-forth rocking a ball would undergo after rolling down a hill and overshooting the bottom. More than just orbital curiosities, L4 and L5 represent special places where one might build and establish space colonies. All you need do is ship raw construction materials to the area (mined not only from Earth, but perhaps from the Moon or an asteroid), leave them there with no risk of drifting away, and return later with more supplies. After all the raw materials were collected in this zero-gravity environment, you could build an enormous space station—tens of miles across—with very little stress on the construction materials. And by rotating the station, the induced centrifugal forces could simulate gravity for its hundreds (or thousands) of residents. The space enthusiasts Keith and Carolyn Henson founded the “L5 Society” in August 1975 for just that purpose, although the society is best remembered for its resonance with the ideas of Princeton physics professor and space visionary Gerard K. O’Neill, who promoted space habitation in his writings such as the 1976 classic The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space. The L5 Society was founded on one guiding principle: “to disband the Society in a mass meeting at L5,” presumably inside a space habitat, thereby declaring “mission accomplished.” In April 1987, the L5 Society merged with the National Space Institute to become the National Space Society, which continues today.

For several minutes during the descent, the heat is so intense that every molecule surrounding the space capsule becomes ionized, cloaking the astronauts in a temporary plasma barrier, through which none of our communication signals can penetrate. This is the famous blackout period when the craft is aglow and Mission Control knows nothing of the astronauts’ well-being. As the craft continues to slow down through the atmosphere, the temperature cools, the air gets denser, and the plasma state can no longer be sustained. The electrons go back home to their atoms and communications are quickly restored.

Heat is the total energy of all the motions of all the molecules in your substance of choice. It so happens that, within the mixture, the range of energies is large: some molecules move quickly, others move slowly. Temperature simply measures their average energy. For example, a cup of freshly brewed coffee may have a higher temperature than a heated swimming pool, but all the water in the pool holds vastly more heat than does the lone cup of coffee. If you rudely pour your 200-degree coffee into the 100-degree pool, the pool won’t suddenly become 150 degrees. And whereas two people in a bed are a source of twice as much heat as one person in a bed, the average temperatures of their two bodies—98.6 and 98.6—do not normally add up to an undercover oven whose temperature is 197.2 degrees.

Speaking of air, at a given time and place on Earth the air temperature in full sunlight is basically the same as the air temperature under a nearby tree. What the shade does is shield you from the Sun’s radiant energy, nearly all of which passes unabsorbed through the atmosphere and lands on your skin, making you feel hotter than the air would by itself. But in empty space, where there is no air, there are no moving molecules to trigger a thermometer reading. So the question “What is the temperature of space?” has no obvious meaning. With nothing touching it, the thermometer can only register the radiant energy from all the light, from all sources, that lands upon it. On the daytime side of our airless Moon, a thermometer would register 400 K (260 degrees F). Move a few feet into the shadow of a boulder, or journey to the Moon’s night side, and the thermometer would instantly drop to 40 K (–390 degrees F). To survive a lunar day without wearing a temperature-controlled space suit, you would have to do pirouettes, alternately baking and then cooling all sides of your body, just to maintain a comfortable temperature.

The largest and most structurally intricate of them are anthracene (C14H10) and pyrene (C16H10), discovered in 2003 in the Red Rectangle Nebula, about 2,300 light-years from Earth, by Adolf N. Witt of the University of Toledo in Ohio and his colleagues. Formed of interconnected, stable rings of carbon, anthracene and pyrene belong to a family of molecules that syllable-loving chemists call polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. And just as the most complex molecules in space are based on carbon, so, of course, are we.

A version of the Drake equation reads: Start with the number of stars in the galaxy (hundreds of billions). Multiply this large number by the fraction of stars with planets. Multiply what remains by the fraction of planets in the habitable zone. Multiply what remains by the fraction of those planets that evolved life. Multiply what remains by the fraction that have evolved intelligent life. Multiply what remains by the fraction that might have developed a technology with which to communicate across interstellar space. Finally, when you introduce a star formation rate and the expected lifetime of a technologically viable civilization you get the number of advanced civilizations that are out there now, possibly waiting for our phone call.

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | Previous | We teach you a few tricks about booking your flight tickets so that you get the best deals at the airfares of your choice. If you’ve watched the film Titanic (and let’s face it, who hasn’t?) and if you’re a travel buff, you might remember what Jack says about travelling and why he gets out as often as he can. He says, “I love waking up in the morning not knowing what’s gonna happen or who I’m gonna meet, where I’m gonna wind up.” Well, Jack had it easier than the rest of us with his penchant for travel. For one thing, he loved to travel rough. Secondly, he didn’t mind lumping himself up with ten other people in a tiny space. For a third, he jumped aboard the Titanic at the last minute. If Jack did the same today with the modern-age flight bookings, he would have to cancel his trip! Imagine booking at the last minute and settling for whatever’s available! That’s a lot of money down the drain. And it must be said that all of your ingenuity is required when you are looking for the lowest airfares. If you want to save money on airfare, don’t be like Jack. But you could certainly use his many wiles to crack the code on getting the best deals on your flight tickets – remember how Jack made his way to the great ship by pure chance? And it must be said that all of your ingenuity is required when you are looking for the lowest airfares. It seems like every time you try to book your tickets, the fares have increased overnight. It’s not pure bad luck that this happens to you, because you’re doing it wrong. If you thought that the guy from your office—who travels more than he walks in to work—has a bag of money to spend, think again. He is probably really clever about booking cheap air tickets that greatly minimizes his overall travel costs. People who vacation frequently are not extremely rich but extremely smart about their bookings. Frequent travellers are extremely smart, not extremely rich. | Photo Courtesy: Unsplash But before you saunter over to your traveller colleague’s desk (if he is not out on holiday, that is) you should read these five easy hacks to book cheap air tickets for your next holiday: 1. If it’s Tuesday… Any frequent flier will tell you that booking an afternoon flight, results in a lot of money saved on airfare. More to the point, a Tuesday afternoon will give you the lowest airfares across airlines. Why does this happen? For one thing, airlines are already booked right from Friday to Monday, with the next spell of travel starting from Wednesday to Friday. So Tuesday is the odd day out. Plus, nobody really relishes flying out in the afternoon and landing at their destination at an unearthly hour, so Tuesday afternoon flights have a lot of vacant seats. Airlines are often glad to sell these empty seats and you are bound to get a good deal on them. You will get an even better deal if you book two months in advance. 2. Browse ‘Incognito’ Checking into the Incognito mode puts you (virtually) in a secret cocoon where you can browse for flights without airlines tracking your cookies and search histories. If you use a Google Chrome browser, you must have noticed that if your mouse pointer hovers over the browser icon, it asks if you want to ‘Browse Incognito’. This Incognito mode is offered by other browsers as well, but Chrome is the best one. Checking into the Incognito mode puts you (virtually) in a secret cocoon where you can browse for flights without airlines tracking your cookies and search histories. You can scour the Internet for domestic flight offers, cheap flight tickets and the lowest airfares without any of the airlines tracking your preferences – hence, airlines cannot offer you inflated flight rates when booking or hike the prices within minutes of you launching your search. This airline behaviour forces customers to book instantly, thus paying a lot of money for the tickets. Avoid this problem by putting the ‘Incognito’ barrier between yourself and other portals. 3. Budget Airlines Will Do the Job You can fly in opulent luxury in the business class of a premium airline or save a lot money by taking a budget airline to the same destination. Sure, you won’t be pampered as much and the food might even be worse than bland, but you can divert the money you saved on flight tickets back into your holiday. If you save money on flights, you could probably use it for an extra day on your trip. 4. Make Your Stopover, Part of Your Holiday So, you have an 8-hour stopover on your India to US flight. Instead of walking around in circles at the stopover and waiting for your flight to roll in, simply include the stopover in your holiday plans. This means that if you have one stop at Dubai, for example, you can book a flight out of Dubai two days later, thus using the two intermediate days to explore Dubai. You can then fly out of the stopover country based on your convenience. Plus, you’ll save money if you book a separate flight out of the stopover destination. 5. Register for Fare Alerts There are tools called ‘fare alerts’ that help potential fliers know when the airfares to their desired destinations drop. These alerts are provided by travel portals and aggregators. You simply have to register with the fare alert site and specify the desired sector and travel date. When airfares drop for those particular specifications, the site sends emails at once – so you can book quickly within the window provided. Some fare alert sites also send fare histories for two weeks, plus flight options to choose from basis the date and time you are comfortable with. That’s it! And it’s a lot of money saved!

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | The presidential race Trump in the dumps The divisiveness of his campaign, and his own loutishness, are giving Donald Trump a ton of trouble Aug 6th 2016 | MECHANICSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA | From the print edition SO CLOSE to the stage that Donald Trump could almost have touched it, a notice on the school wall in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, carried this message: “Welcome to Cumberland Valley where sportsmanship is an expectation. So please …let the spectators be positive.” No chance of that. Even before the Republican nominee appeared, late on August 1st, on a pit-stop between Ohio and New York, the 3,000-odd people packing the gymnasium were spewing hate.  “What should we do with Hillary Clinton?” hollered a local politician, as if this crowd, of young people wearing “Trump that bitch” T-shirts and older ones who apparently did not mind the slogan, needed warming up. “Kill her!” someone shouted. “Lock her up!” the chant began. This is Mr Trump’s achievement. The billionaire demagogue has not merely responded to the grievances of working-class whites—such as the folk in Mechanicsburg, mourning their lost steel mills and the pay rises and other benefits that once accrued to being hardworking and white in America. He has also sought to stoke their anger. Vengeance against “rapist” Mexicans, Muslim fifth-columnists, job-killing outsourcers and his “criminal” Democratic opponent, Mr Trump tells his supporters, is the solution to their gripes. Anyone who says otherwise, he added in his bleak convention speech last month, is conning them. “No longer can we rely on those elites in media and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.” And yet, appearing onstage in Mechanicsburg, to the accompaniment of mock-heroic synthesiser chords, as if he were a game-show host, Mr Trump looked tired and unenthused. He did not thump the air and trumpet polling data as he likes to; how could he? After a disastrous fortnight for the Republican nominee, in which the chaos and thuggery he has brought to American politics appear to have united much of non-Trumpian America in disgust, the polls look bad for him. In Pennsylvania, which he probably must win to gain the White House, he is trailing Mrs Clinton by an average of five points, as he is nationally. “I guess the polls have it sort of even,” is how he put this. He also claimed the polls understate his appeal: “It’s a little embarrassing, people don’t want to say they want to vote for me, but then they get into the booth and they say, ‘Is anyone looking? Boom, I’m taking Trump’!” But there is little evidence for these shy Trumpkins—or that Mr Trump believed his shtick. The speech that followed was even more rambling than usual, and peppered with personal gripes; the boasts were fewer, and his haranguing of the media (“some of the most dishonest people”) went on for longer. At times, Mr Trump sounded deranged. Some of the negotiators he says he will commission to improve America’s trade terms “are horrible, horrible human beings”, he said. “Some of them don’t sleep at night, some of them turn and toss and sweat, they’re turning and tossing and sweating and it’s disgusting, and these are the people we want to negotiate for us, right?” Whose experience, actually, was he describing? With three months to the election, it is early days, and the contest looks close; yet Mr Trump’s campaign is a mess. In Mechanicsburg it was tempting to think he really had seen the writing on the wall. His troubles are in part the flipside of his vote-getting strategy. As an exercise in riling angry whites, his convention speech was masterful; Mr Trump’s lead over Mrs Clinton with high-school-educated whites swelled to almost 40 points in one poll. He could win this group more crushingly than any presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1984. The problem is that, back then, no-college whites represented 62% of the electorate; now they represent around 34%. And Mr Trump’s raving depiction of America as a “divided crime scene” does not ring true to most other Americans. By expanding his angry fan base, Mr Trump enjoyed a small post-convention boost, as newly-crowned nominees usually do. This gave him a small lead over Mrs Clinton in some polls. Yet, among the weeds, his ratings among non-whites and college-educated whites plunged. A poll by Gallup suggests that, for the first time ever recorded, the Republican convention repelled more voters than it attracted. Mr Trump now trails Mrs Clinton with college-educated whites, a group that has voted Republican since polling began, by a five-point margin. If Mr Trump cannot close that gap, he will probably lose. You might think this would have given a pragmatic tycoon, pursuing success with the focused greed of a truffle-hog, a moment’s pause. Yet the incontinence Mr Trump has displayed since the convention has been astounding. In particular, consider the fight he has picked with a pair of Pakistani-Americans, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose 27-year-old son, Humayun, was killed fighting for America in Iraq. Speaking at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on July 28th, with his wife standing demurely beside him, Mr Khan noted that, had the ban Mr Trump swears to impose on foreign Muslims been in place at the time, his son might never have moved to America as a child. “Donald Trump, you’re asking Americans to trust you with their future. Let me ask you: Have you even read the United States constitution?” said Mr Khan. “Have you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.” A “sane, competent” person (a standard Michael Bloomberg, in another memorable moment in Philadelphia, suggested his fellow-New Yorker does not meet) might have responded by praising the Khans and changing the subject. Mr Trump bit back, suggesting Mrs Khan had not delivered the speech because of her religion (“Maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say”). He also protested that, as a hardworking builder, he too had “sacrificed”. Unfortunately for Mr Trump, Mrs Khan, in subsequent television interviews and a piece in the Washington Post, turned out to be almost as articulate as her husband; she had chosen not to speak, she said, because, as she had stood beneath a giant portrait of her dead child, her pain was too great. The row dominated America’s airwaves for almost a week, setting Mr Trump against veterans’ groups, the families of other dead servicemen and a parade of wretched-looking Republican leaders. The efforts of Mr Trump’s campaign team to quash it were hapless. Its spokeswoman claimed Mr Khan had died because of stringent rules of engagement introduced under Mr Obama; he was killed, in 2004, serving George Bush. Meanwhile, out of puerile spite, Mr Trump launched an assault on his disapproving party leadership, by refusing to endorse Senator John McCain, his predecessor in 2008, and Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, in their forthcoming primary fights. He also implied, in an interview, that he would take revenge on his main rivals in the primaries, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, by backing their opponents. No wonder, despite an improvement in Mr Trump’s fund-raising performance (in July he and his party raised $82m), there were reports of confusion in his campaign team. Its chief, Paul Manafort, was also linked to allegations that Mr Trump has an unhealthily high regard for Vladimir Putin; Mr Manafort previously worked for the pro-Putin former government of Ukraine. (In Mechanicsburg Mr Trump repeated his suggestion that Russia should keep annexed Crimea: “You want to have World War III to get it back?”) INTERACTIVE: navigate your way through the policy landscape to a majority Rarely in recent times have America’s fact-based media, on the left and right, its politicians, its armed forces and citizens’ groups seemed so united, in a face-off between decency and rancour, as they do now. The baying of some of Mr Trump’s supporters reinforces the impression: at a rally in Nevada the mother of an air-force officer was jeered after asking his running-mate, Mike Pence, to speak up for the Khans. So, too, for the small but growing majority of Americans who like his record, did an intervention by Barack Obama on August 2nd. Calling Mr Trump “unfit to serve” as president, he urged Republicans to disown him. “There has to come a point”, he said, “at which you say somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn’t have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding, to occupy the most powerful position in the world.” The same day, Richard Hanna, a Republican congressman from New York, said he would vote for Mrs Clinton. “I think Trump is a national embarrassment,” he said. Hours later, a billionaire Republican donor, Meg Whitman, said she would vote for and donate heavily to Mrs Clinton and urge her network to do likewise. On August 3rd even mild Mr Pence broke ranks, declaring that he would support Mr Ryan. There is little to suggest the trickle will become a flood. The partisan division is too deep and the contest still too tight. Mr Trump looks able to rally his embittered, defiant supporters for a huge turnout; none of those in Mechanicsburg, it was depressing to note, admitted to giving a stuff about Mr Trump’s remarks to the Khans. To defeat him, Mrs Clinton would have to rally her supporters similarly. And it is unclear, not least given the low esteem in which many hold her, whether she will be able to do that. But this is a bad moment for Mr Trump, so a good one for America.

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | Financial stability Minsky’s moment The second article in our series on seminal economic ideas looks at Hyman Minsky’s hypothesis that booms sow the seeds of busts Jul 30th 2016 | From the print edition FROM the start of his academic career in the 1950s until 1996, when he died, Hyman Minsky laboured in relative obscurity. His research about financial crises and their causes attracted a few devoted admirers but little mainstream attention: this newspaper cited him only once while he was alive, and it was but a brief mention. So it remained until 2007, when the subprime-mortgage crisis erupted in America. Suddenly, it seemed that everyone was turning to his writings as they tried to make sense of the mayhem. Brokers wrote notes to clients about the “Minsky moment” engulfing financial markets. Central bankers referred to his theories in their speeches. And he became a posthumous media star, with just about every major outlet giving column space and airtime to his ideas. The Economist has mentioned him in at least 30 articles since 2007. If Minsky remained far from the limelight throughout his life, it is at least in part because his approach shunned academic conventions. He started his university education in mathematics but made little use of calculations when he shifted to economics, despite the discipline’s growing emphasis on quantitative methods. Instead, he pieced his views together in his essays, lectures and books, including one about John Maynard Keynes, the economist who most influenced his thinking. He also gained hands-on experience, serving on the board of Mark Twain Bank in St Louis, Missouri, where he taught. Having grown up during the Depression, Minsky was minded to dwell on disaster. Over the years he came back to the same fundamental problem again and again. He wanted to understand why financial crises occurred. It was an unpopular focus. The dominant belief in the latter half of the 20th century was that markets were efficient. The prospect of a full-blown calamity in developed economies sounded far-fetched. There might be the occasional stockmarket bust or currency crash, but modern economies had, it seemed, vanquished their worst demons. Against those certitudes, Minsky, an owlish man with a shock of grey hair, developed his “financial-instability hypothesis”. It is an examination of how long stretches of prosperity sow the seeds of the next crisis, an important lens for understanding the tumult of the past decade. But the history of the hypothesis itself is just as important. Its trajectory from the margins of academia to a subject of mainstream debate shows how the study of economics is adapting to a much-changed reality since the global financial crisis. Minsky started with an explanation of investment. It is, in essence, an exchange of money today for money tomorrow. A firm pays now for the construction of a factory; profits from running the facility will, all going well, translate into money for it in coming years. Put crudely, money today can come from one of two sources: the firm’s own cash or that of others (for example, if the firm borrows from a bank). The balance between the two is the key question for the financial system. Minsky distinguished between three kinds of financing. The first, which he called “hedge financing”, is the safest: firms rely on their future cashflow to repay all their borrowings. For this to work, they need to have very limited borrowings and healthy profits. The second, speculative financing, is a bit riskier: firms rely on their cashflow to repay the interest on their borrowings but must roll over their debt to repay the principal. This should be manageable as long as the economy functions smoothly, but a downturn could cause distress. The third, Ponzi financing, is the most dangerous. Cashflow covers neither principal nor interest; firms are betting only that the underlying asset will appreciate by enough to cover their liabilities. If that fails to happen, they will be left exposed. Economies dominated by hedge financing—that is, those with strong cashflows and low debt levels—are the most stable. When speculative and, especially, Ponzi financing come to the fore, financial systems are more vulnerable. If asset values start to fall, either because of monetary tightening or some external shock, the most overstretched firms will be forced to sell their positions. This further undermines asset values, causing pain for even more firms. They could avoid this trouble by restricting themselves to hedge financing. But over time, particularly when the economy is in fine fettle, the temptation to take on debt is irresistible. When growth looks assured, why not borrow more? Banks add to the dynamic, lowering their credit standards the longer booms last. If defaults are minimal, why not lend more? Minsky’s conclusion was unsettling. Economic stability breeds instability. Periods of prosperity give way to financial fragility. With overleveraged banks and no-money-down mortgages still fresh in the mind after the global financial crisis, Minsky’s insight might sound obvious. Of course, debt and finance matter. But for decades the study of economics paid little heed to the former and relegated the latter to a sub-discipline, not an essential element in broader theories. Minsky was a maverick. He challenged both the Keynesian backbone of macroeconomics and a prevailing belief in efficient markets. It is perhaps odd to describe his ideas as a critique of Keynesian doctrine when Minsky himself idolised Keynes. But he believed that the doctrine had strayed too far from Keynes’s own ideas. Economists had created models to put Keynes’s words to work in explaining the economy. None is better known than the IS-LM model, largely developed by John Hicks and Alvin Hansen, which shows the relationship between investment and money. It remains a potent tool for teaching and for policy analysis. But Messrs Hicks and Hansen largely left the financial sector out of the picture, even though Keynes was keenly aware of the importance of markets. To Minsky, this was an “unfair and naive representation of Keynes’s subtle and sophisticated views”. Minsky’s financial-instability hypothesis helped fill in the holes. His challenge to the prophets of efficient markets was even more acute. Eugene Fama and Robert Lucas, among others, persuaded most of academia and policymaking circles that markets tended towards equilibrium as people digested all available information. The structure of the financial system was treated as almost irrelevant. In recent years, behavioural economists have attacked one plank of efficient-market theory: people, far from being rational actors who maximise their gains, are often clueless about what they want and make the wrong decisions. But years earlier Minsky had attacked another: deep-seated forces in financial systems propel them towards trouble, he argued, with stability only ever a fleeting illusion. Outside-in Yet as an outsider in the sometimes cloistered world of economics, Minsky’s influence was, until recently, limited. Investors were faster than professors to latch onto his views. More than anyone else it was Paul McCulley of PIMCO, a fund-management group, who popularised his ideas. He coined the term “Minsky moment” to describe a situation when debt levels reach breaking-point and asset prices across the board start plunging. Mr McCulley initially used the term in explaining the Russian financial crisis of 1998. Since the global turmoil of 2008, it has become ubiquitous. For investment analysts and fund managers, a “Minsky moment” is now virtually synonymous with a financial crisis. Minsky’s writing about debt and the dangers in financial innovation had the great virtue of according with experience. But this virtue also points to what some might see as a shortcoming. In trying to paint a more nuanced picture of the economy, he relinquished some of the potency of elegant models. That was fine as far as he was concerned; he argued that generalisable theories were bunkum. He wanted to explain specific situations, not economics in general. He saw the financial-instability hypothesis as relevant to the case of advanced capitalist economies with deep, sophisticated markets. It was not meant to be relevant in all scenarios. These days, for example, it is fashionable to ask whether China is on the brink of a Minsky moment after its alarming debt growth of the past decade. Yet a country in transition from socialism to a market economy and with an immature financial system is not what Minsky had in mind. Shunning the power of equations and models had its costs. It contributed to Minsky’s isolation from mainstream theories. Economists did not entirely ignore debt, even if they studied it only sparingly. Some, such as Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and Ben Bernanke, who would later become chairman of the Federal Reserve, looked at how credit could amplify business cycles. Minsky’s work might have complemented theirs, but they did not refer to it. It was as if it barely existed. Since Minsky’s death, others have started to correct the oversight, grafting his theories onto general models. The Levy Economics Institute of Bard College in New York, where he finished his career (it still holds an annual conference in his honour), has published work that incorporates his ideas in calculations. One Levy paper, published in 2000, developed a Minsky-inspired model linking investment and cashflow. A 2005 paper for the Bank for International Settlements, a forum for central banks, drew on Minsky in building a model of how people assess their assets after making losses. In 2010 Paul Krugman, a Nobel prize-winning economist who is best known these days as a New York Times columnist, co-authored a paper that included the concept of a “Minsky moment” to model the impact of deleveraging on the economy. Some researchers are also starting to test just how accurate Minsky’s insights really were: a 2014 discussion paper for the Bank of Finland looked at debt-to-cashflow ratios, finding them to be a useful indicator of systemic risk. Debtor’s prism Still, it would be a stretch to expect the financial-instability hypothesis to become a new foundation for economic theory. Minsky’s legacy has more to do with focusing on the right things than correctly structuring quantifiable models. It is enough to observe that debt and financial instability, his main preoccupations, have become some of the principal topics of inquiry for economists today. A new version of the “Handbook of Macroeconomics”, an influential survey that was first published in 1999, is in the works. This time, it will make linkages between finance and economic activity a major component, with at least two articles citing Minsky. As Mr Krugman has quipped: “We are all Minskyites now.” Central bankers seem to agree. In a speech in 2009, before she became head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen said Minsky’s work had “become required reading”. In a 2013 speech, made while he was governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King agreed with Minsky’s view that stability in credit markets leads to exuberance and eventually to instability. Mark Carney, Lord King’s successor, has referred to Minsky moments on at least two occasions. Will the moment last? Minsky’s own theory suggests it will eventually peter out. Economic growth is still shaky and the scars of the global financial crisis visible. In the Minskyan trajectory, this is when firms and banks are at their most cautious, wary of repeating past mistakes and determined to fortify their balance-sheets. But in time, memories of the 2008 turmoil will dim. Firms will again race to expand, banks to fund them and regulators to loosen constraints. The warnings of Minsky will fade away. The further we move on from the last crisis, the less we want to hear from those who see another one coming.  LATER IN THIS SERIES: • The Stolper-Samuelson theorem • The Keynesian multiplier • The Nash equilibrium • The Mundell-Fleming trilemma This article was downloaded by calibre from http://www.economist.com/news/economics-brief/21702740-second-article-our-series-seminal-economic-ideas-looks-hyman-minskys/print | Section Menu | Main Menu |

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | Tariffs and wages An inconvenient iota of truth The third in our series looks at the Stolper-Samuelson theorem Aug 6th 2016 | From the print edition IN AUGUST 1960 Wolfgang Stolper, an American economist working for Nigeria’s development ministry, embarked on a tour of the country’s poor northern region, a land of “dirt and dignity”, long ruled by conservative emirs and “second-rate British civil servants who didn’t like business”. In this bleak commercial landscape one strange flower bloomed: Kaduna Textile Mills, built by a Lancashire firm a few years before, employed 1,400 people paid as little as £4.80 ($6.36) a day in today’s prices. And yet it required a 90% tariff to compete. Skilled labour was scarce: the mill had found only six northerners worth training as foremen (three failed, two were “so-so”, one was “superb”). Some employees walked ten miles to work, others carried the hopes of mendicant relatives on their backs. Many quit, adding to the cost of finding and training replacements. Those who stayed were often too tired, inexperienced or ill-educated to maintain the machines properly. “African labour is the worst paid and most expensive in the world,” Stolper complained.  He concluded that Nigeria was not yet ready for large-scale industry. “Any industry which required high duties impoverished the country and wasn’t worth having,” he believed. This was not a popular view among his fellow planners. But Stolper’s ideas carried unusual weight. He was a successful schmoozer, able to drink like a fish. He liked “getting his hands dirty” in empirical work. And his trump card, which won him the respect of friends and the ear of superiors, was the “Stolper-Samuelson theorem” that bore his name. The theorem was set out 20 years earlier in a seminal paper, co-authored by Paul Samuelson, one of the most celebrated thinkers in the discipline. It shed new light on an old subject: the relationship between tariffs and wages. Its fame and influence were pervasive and persistent, preceding Stolper to Nigeria and outlasting his death, in 2002, at the age of 89. Even today, the theorem is shaping debates on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) between America and 11 other Pacific-rim countries. The paper was “remarkable”, according to Alan Deardorff of the University of Michigan, partly because it proved something seemingly obvious to non-economists: free trade with low-wage nations could hurt workers in a high-wage country. This commonsensical complaint had traditionally cut little ice with economists. They pointed out that poorly paid labour is not necessarily cheap, because low wages often reflect poor productivity—as Kaduna Textile Mills showed. The Stolper-Samuelson theorem, however, found “an iota of possible truth” (as Samuelson put it later) in the hoary argument that workers in rich countries needed protection from “pauper labour” paid a pittance elsewhere. To understand why the theorem made a splash, it helps to understand the pool of received wisdom it disturbed. Economists had always known that tariffs helped the industries sheltered by them. But they were equally adamant that free trade benefited countries as a whole. David Ricardo showed in 1817 that a country could benefit from trade even if it did everything better than its neighbours. A country that is better at everything will still be “most better”, so to speak, at something. It should concentrate on that, Ricardo showed, importing what its neighbours do “least worse”. If bad grammar is not enough to make the point, an old analogy might. Suppose that the best lawyer in town is also the best typist. He takes only ten minutes to type a document that his secretary finishes in 20. In that sense, typing costs him less. But in the time he spent typing he could have been lawyering. And he could have done vastly more legal work than his secretary could do, even in twice the time. In that sense typing costs him far more. It thus pays the fast-typing lawyer to specialise in legal work and “import” typing. In Ricardo’s model, the same industry can require more labour in one country than in another. Such differences in labour requirements are one motivation for trade. Another is differences in labour supplies. In some nations, such as America, labour is scarce relative to the amount of land, capital or education the country has accumulated. In others the reverse is true. Countries differ in their mix of labour, land, capital, skill and other “factors of production”. In the 1920s and 1930s Eli Heckscher and his student, Bertil Ohlin, pioneered a model of trade driven by these differences. In their model, trade allowed countries like America to economise on labour, by concentrating on capital-intensive activities that made little use of it. Industries that required large amounts of elbow grease could be left to foreigners. In this way, trade alleviated labour scarcity. That was good for the country, but was it good for workers? Scarcity is a source of value. If trade eased workers’ rarity value, it would also erode their bargaining power. It was quite possible that free trade might reduce workers’ share of the national income. But since trade would also enlarge that income, it should still leave workers better off, most economists felt. Moreover, even if foreign competition depressed “nominal” wages, it would also reduce the price of importable goods. Depending on their consumption patterns, workers’ purchasing power might then increase, even if their wages fell. Working hypothesis There were other grounds for optimism. Labour, unlike oil, arable land, blast furnaces and many other productive resources, is required in every industry. Thus no matter how a country’s industrial mix evolves, labour will always be in demand. Over time, labour is also versatile and adaptable. If trade allows one industry to expand and obliges another to contract, new workers will simply migrate towards the sunlit industrial uplands and turn their backs on the sunset sectors. “In the long run the working class as a whole has nothing to fear from international trade,” concluded Gottfried Haberler, an Austrian economist, in 1936. Stolper was not so sure. He felt that Ohlin’s model disagreed with Haberler even if Ohlin himself was less clear-cut. Stolper shared his doubts with Samuelson, his young Harvard colleague. “Work it out, Wolfie,” Samuelson urged. The pair worked it out first with a simple example: a small economy blessed with abundant capital (or land), but scarce labour, making watches and wheat. Subsequent economists have clarified the intuition underlying their model. In one telling, watchmaking (which is labour-intensive) benefits from a 10% tariff. When the tariff is repealed, watch prices fall by a similar amount. The industry, which can no longer break even, begins to lay off workers and vacate land. When the dust settles, what happens to wages and land rents? A layman might assume that both fall by 10%, returning the watchmakers to profit. A clever layman might guess instead that rents will fall by less than wages, because the shrinkage of watchmaking releases more labour than land. Both would be wrong, because both ignore what is going on in the rest of the economy. In particular, wheat prices have not fallen. Thus if wages and rents both decrease, wheat growers will become unusually profitable and expand. Since they require more land than labour, their expansion puts more upward pressure on rents than on wages. At the same time, the watch industry’s contraction puts more downward pressure on wages than on rents. In the push and pull between the two industries, wages fall disproportionately—by more than 10%—while rents, paradoxically, rise a little. This combination of slightly pricier land and much cheaper labour restores the modus vivendi between the two industries, halting the watchmakers’ contraction and the wheat-farmers’ expansion. Because the farmers need more land than labour, slightly higher rents deter them as forcefully as much lower wages attract them. The combination also restores the profits of the watchmakers, because the much cheaper labour helps them more than the slightly pricier land hurts them. The upshot is that wages have fallen by more than watch prices, and rents have actually risen. It follows that workers are unambiguously worse off. Their versatility will not save them. Nor does it matter what mix of watches and wheat they buy. Stolper, Samuelson and their successors subsequently extended the theorem to more complicated cases, albeit with some loss of crispness. One popular variation is to split labour into two—skilled and unskilled. That kind of distinction helps shed light on what Stolper later witnessed in Nigeria, where educated workers were vanishingly rare. With a 90% tariff, Kaduna Textile Mills could afford to train local foremen and hire technicians. Without it, Nigeria would probably have imported textiles from Lancashire instead. Free trade would thus have hurt the “scarce” factor. In rich countries, skilled workers are abundant by international standards and unskilled workers are scarce. As globalisation has advanced, college-educated workers have enjoyed faster wage gains than their less educated countrymen, many of whom have suffered stagnant real earnings. On the face of it, this wage pattern is consistent with the Stolper-Samuelson theorem. Globalisation has hurt the scarce “factor” (unskilled labour) and helped the abundant one. But look closer and puzzles remain. The theorem is unable to explain why skilled workers have prospered even in developing countries, where they are not abundant. Its assumption that every country makes everything—both watches and wheat—may also overstate trade’s dangers. In reality, countries will import some things they no longer produce and others they never made. Imports cannot hurt a local industry that never existed (nor keep hurting an industry that is already dead). Some of the theorem’s other premises are also questionable. Its assumption that workers will move from one industry to another can blind it to the true source of their hardship. Chinese imports have not squeezed American manufacturing workers into less labour-intensive industries; they have squeezed them out of the labour force altogether, according to David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his co-authors. The “China shock”, they point out, was concentrated in a few hard-hit manufacturing localities from which workers struggled to escape. Thanks to globalisation, goods now move easily across borders. But workers move uneasily even within them. Grain men Acclaim for the Stolper-Samuelson theorem was not instant or universal. The original paper was rejected by the American Economic Review, whose editors described it as “a very narrow study in formal theory”. Even Samuelson’s own textbook handled the proposition gingerly. After acknowledging that free trade could leave American workers worse off, he added a health warning: “Although admitting this as a slight theoretical possibility, most economists are still inclined to think that its grain of truth is outweighed by other, more realistic considerations,” he wrote. What did Stolper think? A veteran of economic practice as well as principles, he was not a slave to formalism or blind to “realistic considerations”. Indeed, in Nigeria, Stolper discovered that he could “suspend theory” more easily than some of his politically minded colleagues (perhaps because theory was revealed to them, but written by him). He was nonetheless sure that his paper was worth the fuss. He said he would give his left eye to produce another one like it. By the paper’s 50th anniversary, he had indeed lost the use of that eye, he pointed out wistfully. The other side of the bargain was, however, left unfulfilled: he never did write another paper as good. Not many people have.

And here’s one for your calendar: On Friday the 13th of April, 2029, an asteroid large enough to fill the Rose Bowl as though it were an egg cup, will fly so close to Earth that it will dip below the altitude of our communication satellites. We did not name this asteroid Bambi. Instead, it’s named Apophis, after the Egyptian god of darkness and death. If the trajectory of Apophis at close approach passes within a narrow range of altitudes called the “keyhole,” the precise influence of Earth’s gravity on its orbit will guarantee that seven years later in 2036, on its next time around, the asteroid will hit Earth directly, slamming in the Pacific Ocean between California and Hawaii. The tsunami it creates will wipe out the entire west coast of North America, bury Hawaii, and devastate all the land masses of the Pacific Rim. If Apophis misses the keyhole in 2029, then, of course, we have nothing to worry about in 2036.

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | Fiscal multipliers Where does the buck stop? Fiscal stimulus, an idea championed by John Maynard Keynes, has gone in and out of fashion Aug 13th 2016 | From the print edition AT THE height of the euro crisis, with government-bond yields soaring in several southern European countries and defaults looming, the European Central Bank and the healthier members of the currency club fended off disaster by offering bail-outs. But these came with conditions, most notably strict fiscal discipline, intended to put government finances back on a sustainable footing. Some economists argued that painful budget cuts were an unfortunate necessity. Others said that the cuts might well prove counterproductive, by lowering growth and therefore government revenues, leaving the affected countries even poorer and more indebted. In 2013 economists at the IMF rendered their verdict on these austerity programmes: they had done far more economic damage than had been initially predicted, including by the fund itself. What had the IMF got wrong when it made its earlier, more sanguine forecasts? It had dramatically underestimated the fiscal multiplier. The multiplier is a simple, powerful and hotly debated idea. It is a critical element of Keynesian macroeconomics. Over the past 80 years the significance it has been accorded has fluctuated wildly. It was once seen as a matter of fundamental importance, then as a discredited notion. It is now back in vogue again. The idea of the multiplier emerged from the intense argument over how to respond to the Depression. In the 1920s Britain had sunk into an economic slump. The first world war had left prices higher and the pound weaker. The government was nonetheless determined to restore the pound to its pre-war value. In doing so, it kept monetary policy too tight, initiating a spell of prolonged deflation and economic weakness. The economists of the day debated what might be done to improve conditions for suffering workers. Among the suggestions was a programme of public investment which, some thought, would put unemployed Britons to work. The British government would countenance no such thing. It espoused the conventional wisdom of the day—what is often called the “Treasury view”. It believed that public spending, financed through borrowing, would not boost overall economic activity, because the supply of savings in the economy available for borrowing is fixed. If the government commandeered capital to build new roads, for instance, it would simply be depriving private firms of the same amount of money. Higher spending and employment in one part of the economy would come at the expense of lower spending and employment in another. As the world slipped into depression, however, and Britain’s economic crisis deepened, the voices questioning this view grew louder. In 1931 Baron Kahn, a British economist, published a paper espousing an alternative theory: that public spending would yield both the primary boost from the direct spending, but also “beneficial repercussions”. If road-building, for instance, took workers off the dole and led them to increase their own spending, he argued, then there might be a sustained rise in total employment as a result. Kahn’s paper was in line with the thinking of John Maynard Keynes, the leading British economist of the day, who was working on what would become his masterpiece, “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money”. In it, Keynes gave a much more complete account of how the multiplier might work, and how it might enable a government to drag a slumping economy back to health. Keynes was a singular character, and one of the great thinkers of the 20th century. He looked every inch a patrician figure, with his tweed suits and walrus moustache. Yet he was also a free spirit by the standards of the day, associating with the artists and writers of the Bloomsbury Group, whose members included Virginia Woolf and E.M. Forster. Keynes advised the government during the first world war and participated in the Versailles peace conference, which ended up extracting punitive reparations from Germany. The experience was dispiriting for Keynes, who wrote a number of scathing essays in the 1920s, pointing out the risks of the agreement and of the post-war economic system more generally. Frustrated by his inability to change the minds of those in power, and by a deepening global recession, Keynes set out to write a magnum opus criticising the economic consensus and laying out an alternative. He positioned the “General Theory” as a revolutionary text—and so it proved. The book is filled with economic insights. Yet its most important contribution is the reasoning behind the proposition that when an economy is operating below full employment, demand rather than supply determines the level of investment and national income. Keynes supposed there was a “multiplier effect” from changes in investment spending. A bit of additional money spent by the government, for instance, would add directly to a nation’s output (and income). In the first instance, this money would go to contractors, suppliers, civil servants or welfare recipients. They would in turn spend some of the extra income. The beneficiaries of that spending would also splash out a bit, adding still more to economic activity, and so on. Should the government cut back, the ill effects would multiply in the same way. Keynes thought this insight was especially important because of what he called “liquidity preference”. He reckoned that people like to have some liquid assets on hand if possible, in case of emergency. In times of financial worry, demand for cash or similarly liquid assets rises; investors begin to worry more about the return of capital rather than the return on capital. Keynes posited that this might lead to a “general glut”: a world in which everyone tries to hold more money, depressing spending, which in turn depresses production and income, leaving people still worse off. In this world, lowering interest rates to stimulate growth does not help very much. Nor are rates very sensitive to increases in government borrowing, given the glut of saving. Government spending to boost the economy could therefore generate a big rise in employment for only a negligible increase in interest rates. Classical economists thought public-works spending would “crowd out” private investment; Keynes saw that during periods of weak demand it might “crowd in” private spending, through the multiplier effect. Keynes’s reasoning was affirmed by the economic impact of increased government expenditure during the second world war. Massive military spending in Britain and America contributed to soaring economic growth. This, combined with the determination to prevent a recurrence of the Depression, prompted policymakers to adopt Keynesian economics, and the multiplier, as the centrepiece of the post-war economic order. Other economists picked up where Keynes left off. Alvin Hansen and Paul Samuelson constructed equations to predict how a rise or fall in spending in one part of the economy would propagate across the whole of it. Governments took it for granted that managing economic demand was their responsibility. By the 1960s Keynes’s intellectual victory seemed complete. In a story in Time magazine, published in 1965, Milton Friedman declared (in a quote often attributed to Richard Nixon), “We are all Keynesians now.” But the Keynesian consensus fractured in the 1970s. Its dominance was eroded by the ideas of Friedman himself, who linked variations in the business cycle to growth (or decline) in the money supply. Fancy Keynesian multipliers were not needed to keep an economy on track, he reckoned. Instead, governments simply needed to pursue a policy of stable money growth. An even greater challenge came from the emergence of the “rational expectations” school of economics, led by Robert Lucas. Rational-expectations economists supposed that fiscal policy would be undermined by forward-looking taxpayers. They should understand that government borrowing would eventually need to be repaid, and that stimulus today would necessitate higher taxes tomorrow. They should therefore save income earned as a result of stimulus in order to have it on hand for when the bill came due. The multiplier on government spending might in fact be close to zero, as each extra dollar is almost entirely offset by increased private saving. Rubbing salt in The economists behind many of these criticisms clustered in colleges in the Midwest of America, most notably the University of Chicago. Because of their proximity to America’s Great Lakes, their approach to macroeconomics came to be known as the “freshwater” school. They argued that macroeconomic models had to begin with equations that described how rational individuals made decisions. The economic experience of the 1970s seemed to bear out their criticisms of Keynes: governments sought to boost slow-growing economies with fiscal and monetary stimulus, only to find that inflation and interest rates rose even as unemployment remained high. Freshwater economists declared victory. In an article published in 1979 and entitled “After Keynesian Economics”, Robert Lucas and Tom Sargent, both eventual Nobel-prize winners, wrote that the flaws in Keynesian economic models were “fatal”. Keynesian macroeconomic models were “of no value in guiding policy”. These attacks, in turn, prompted the emergence of “New Keynesian” economists, who borrowed elements of the freshwater approach while retaining the belief that recessions were market failures that could be fixed through government intervention. Because most of them were based at universities on America’s coasts, they were dubbed “saltwater” economists. The most prominent included Stanley Fischer, now the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve; Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary; and Greg Mankiw, head of George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. In their models fiscal policy was all but neutered. Instead, they argued that central banks could and should do the heavy lifting of economic management: exercising a deft control that ought to cancel out the effects of government spending—and squash the multiplier. Yet in Japan since the 1990s, and in most of the rich world since the recession that followed the global financial crisis, cutting interest rates to zero has proved inadequate to revive flagging economies. Many governments turned instead to fiscal stimulus to get their economies going. In America the administration of Barack Obama succeeded in securing a stimulus package worth over $800 billion. As a new debate over multipliers flared, freshwater types stood their ground. John Cochrane of the University of Chicago said of Keynesian ideas in 2009: “It’s not part of what anybody has taught graduate students since the 1960s. They are fairy tales that have been proved false. It is very comforting in times of stress to go back to the fairy tales we heard as children, but it doesn’t make them less false.” The practical experience of the recession gave economists plenty to study, however. Scores of papers have been published since 2008 attempting to estimate fiscal multipliers. Most suggest that, with interest rates close to zero, fiscal stimulus carries a multiplier of at least one. The IMF, for instance, concluded that the (harmful) multiplier for fiscal contractions was often 1.5 or more. Even as many policymakers remain committed to fiscal consolidation, plenty of economists now argue that insufficient fiscal stimulus has been among the biggest failures of the post-crisis era. Mr Summers and Antonio Fatas suggest, for example, that austerity has substantially reduced growth, leading to levels of public debt that are higher than they would have been had enthusiastic stimulus been used to revive growth. Decades after its conception, Keynes’s multiplier remains as relevant, and as controversial, as ever.

The potential energy of the weights was transferred into the water and successfully raised its temperature. Joule describes his effort: The paddle moved with great resistance in the can of water, so that the weights (each of four pounds) descended at the slow rate of about one foot per second. The height of the pulleys from the ground was twelve yards, and consequently, when the weights had descended through that distance, they had to be wound up again in order to renew the motion of the paddle. After this operation had been repeated sixteen times, the increase of the temperature of the water was ascertained by means of a very sensible and accurate thermometer…. I may therefore conclude that the existence of an equivalent relation between heat and the ordinary forms of mechanical power is proved…. If my views are correct, the temperature of the river Niagara will be raised about one fifth of a degree by its fall of 160 feet. (Shamos 1959, p. 170)

A common variety of black hole contains several times the mass of the Sun, but packs it all within an event horizon only about a dozen miles across. These are what most astronomers discuss in casual conversations on the subject. In a fall toward this beast, your body would begin to break apart within 100 miles of the center. Another common variety of black hole reaches a billion times the mass of the Sun and is contained within an event horizon that is nearly the size of the entire solar system. Black holes such as these are what lurk in the centers of galaxies.

When the Moon is a thin crescent, you can find the Sun 20 or 30 degrees to its right. As the Moon orbits Earth, the angle between it and the Sun grows, allowing more and more of its visible surface to be lit, reaching 100 percent frontal illumination at 180 degrees. (This monthly Earth-Sun-Moon configuration is known as syzygy, which reliably gives you a full Moon and, occasionally, a lunar eclipse.)

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | Previous | By Ahmad Mobeen On November 1, 2015, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, issued a joint statement demanding an immediate end to interstate conflicts, poor reception of aid requests, explicit violations of international law and the net indifference towards the refugee crisis. It is to be noted that this was not the first time that global leadership had been singled out by the top humanitarian authorities (label not undisputed; see below). On October 24, 2015, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon reprimanded the P5, the UN Security Council’s five permanent members – Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States – on their futile efforts at peace-building, stressing that they “weren’t doing much at all” and that they need to fix the way they operate. Whats Happens After the Threshold? There is a reason why the breaking point of patience seems to have passed. The widespread use of heavy weaponry in civilian majority areas have left millions of people throughout the globe displaced and left them shaken to their core. The widespread use of heavy weaponry in civilian majority areas have left millions of people throughout the globe displaced and left them shaken to their core. The almost unbelievable statistic that civilians account for 93% of all deaths and injuries in Yemen reveals the macabre and inhumane picture of the Middle Eastern scenario. Furthermore, the constant violence in Syria has killed more than 250,000 people and has forced some 4 million to flee the country. Out of these, about 1000 lost their lives after exposure to chemical weapons, 9000 after being kidnapped and tortured (both by terrorists and pro-government forces) and 600 due to starvation, dehydration and a lack of basic medical care. All this misery and pain triggered a multitude of debates about the urgency of the situation and highlighted the role and responsibilities of other nations regarding the matter. Unfortunately, however, it was not enough, and this brings us to the second issue that the Red Cross chief highlighted – an unending shortage of aid. Syria has been converted into rubble with more than 250,000 deaths. | Source: Google Images Even the most economically sufficient nations such as the United States have given too meager an amount to the accelerating millions that require it. The failure of meeting the demand for monetary help is nothing new, as the withholding effects of preferences like the geopolitical location of the beneficiary, historical relationships, and the potential strategic trade incentives have always been well documented by economic geographers and sociologists. The 2005 Niger famine is a clear example; out of USD $300 million annual aid (substantially lower than what was required) flowing into Niger at that time, only about 5 percent of it was coming from the United States, roughly only a nickel per American per year! Very UN-likely Mr. Moon and Mr. Maurer also reproofed nations on their lack of adherence to International law, terming it detrimental to the very concept of peace, worrying the latter might get shrouded in an identity crisis with the coming generation unable to positively discriminate between acceptable actions and otherwise. Basic human rights are being ignored in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Nigeria,  as attacks on housing societies, hospitals, schools and places of worship become conspicuously frequent and pandemic. “Enough is enough!”, Mr. Moon pleaded, “Even war has rules. It is time to enforce them.” The current global crisis is a crisis of humanity, no doubt, and the question now becomes what can (if at all) be done about it. There is speculation that the UN, especially its Security Council, has lost its power as the undisputed leader on international affairs. While this is true to some extent, the development cannot be termed recent: the veto powers, “green room” meetings and the preferential rights systems of the multilateral agencies have been criticized for eliciting self-interest, face-saving and under-representation of nations since their inception. However, this is not an excuse to let it continue, as a serious effort towards an all-inclusive dealing of affairs would result in a more efficient and equitable running of the aforementioned organizations. It is also worthwhile to remember that interstate (and even intrastate) negotiations should be encouraged and showcased as a worthy alternative to war and its destructive consequences. Although intelligence sharing and policy revising are a welcome development, what is required is perhaps cooperation on a bigger scale. Accepting and appreciating the sovereignty of other states and their physical independence is as crucial as knowing when to intervene and when not to. These processes are not mutually exclusive and the Weberian concept of “Verstehen” (putting oneself in the shoes of others) may very well be advised to the nation states when deciding on such critical issues. International Peace into Pieces Coming to the greatest post-WWII exodus currently jolting the world, the words of impeached Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff resonated with me a lot. Addressing the European Union at the United Nations General Assembly last September, she argued, “In a world where goods, capital, data and ideas flow freely, it is absurd to impede the flow of people!”. And the problem, as it has been reiterated many times, is not EU-centric (for instance, the zero admittance policy of the Gulf states remains an embarrassing black mark on their global position and reception). The crux of the predicament is that humanity as a whole has failed. Mr. Moon is correct when concluding that wrong doers consistently evade punishment because (among other things).If the Gulf states do not accept any refugees and refuse to aid them via alternate means (for example, monetarily), then the other states are equally responsible for inaction against the Gulf states. Oil money is good, and so are intercontinental trade negotiations, but the question is, where do we draw the line? Oil money is good, and so are intercontinental trade negotiations, but the question is, where do we draw the line? Civil rights abuse is widespread in many of the beneficiaries and benefactors in this core-periphery model, and strict measures are necessary to address them. But in the modern business-oriented world, alas, is it all “strictly financial”?

For Liesel, it was a ride in a car. She’d never been in one before. There was the constant rise and fall of her stomach, and the futile hopes that they’d lose their way or change their minds. Among it all, her thoughts couldn’t help turning toward her mother, back at the Bahnhof, waiting to leave again. Shivering. Bundled up in that useless coat. She’d be eating her nails, waiting for the train. The platform would be long and uncomfortable—a slice of cold cement. Would she keep an eye out for the approximate burial site of her son on the return trip? Or would sleep be too heavy?

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | Thailand’s economy The dangers of farsightedness The junta lavishes attention on the economy’s future but neglects the poor of today Oct 1st 2016 | KHON KAEN | From the print edition IN PLANNING for the future, democratic politicians dare not look far beyond the next election, lest they lose power before the future arrives. Thailand’s military rulers have no such qualms. They have rewritten the constitution to guarantee themselves a guiding hand over future governments even after elections resume. That has given them the confidence to draw up a 20-year plan for the economy. In a speech in Bangkok on September 28th, Prayuth Chan-ocha, coup leader and prime minister, promised to turn Thailand into a developed country by 2036. The junta sees Thailand climbing to a fourth stage of economic development (“Thailand 4.0”) beyond agriculture, light manufacturing and heavy industry. This next stage will feature new “growth engines”, such as biotechnology, the internet of things and “mechatronics” (a fusion of mechanics and electronics).  In pursuit of this vision, some welcome structural reforms are under way. The junta has passed an inheritance tax; one on land and property will follow. It has also begun to reform the corporate governance of the country’s 56 state-owned enterprises, hoping to free them from political interference, even if not from public ownership. To bind the country closer together, the government is contemplating big outlays on infrastructure, including $51 billion to be spent on railways, roads and airports. Much remains to be done. Thailand’s service sector is the most protected in South-East Asia. Neither America nor the European Union is willing to negotiate a free-trade deal with the junta, even as they talk to such regional rivals as Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Nonetheless, the regime’s economic plan has left it open to an unusual charge: it is holding too many seminars on the long term and neglecting the short term, says Suradech Taweesaengsakulthai, a businessman in Khon Kaen, a north-eastern provincial capital. The junta’s efforts to advance structural reform are more impressive than its efforts to revive demand. That is not something that can be said about most of the world’s governments. A revival of domestic demand is necessary. Thailand’s economy is operating well below capacity. Inflation is far less than the central bank’s target; the current-account surplus is strikingly high (about 10% of GDP); private credit is subdued (growing by 5% in the first quarter) and sovereign debt is modest (44% of GDP in 2015). Public investment, thanks to the junta’s big plans, is growing at a double-digit pace, but Thailand’s indebted consumers remain cautious and private investment is stagnant (see chart). The overall shortfall in demand will amount to about 1.4% of GDP this year, according to the IMF. Strip out spending by foreign tourists and the gap is even larger, as the current-account surplus attests. This lack of spending is manifest in the inflation figures: consumer prices fell for 15 straight months last year and this. They rose by only 0.3% in the year to August. Stagnant demand is especially visible in the provinces. The rural economy has contracted for seven quarters in a row. Nongpetch Khunnasarn, a used-car dealer outside Khon Kaen city, the political heartland of the government ousted by the junta, has not made a sale for two months. Under Yingluck Shinawatra, the deposed prime minister, she sold one a week. In Ban Phue, an hour’s drive from Khon Kaen, two years of drought and falling agricultural prices have led to a collapse in farm incomes. Last year Bangkok ordered farmers not to plant a second crop, because of poor rains. This year farmers are running a lottery to determine who can draw stored rainwater. Thailand’s farmers used to rely on ballots, not lottery tickets, to get what they needed. When Thaksin Shinawatra, Yingluck’s brother, became prime minister in 2001 he aimed to bolster the income of the poor who voted for him. He introduced cheap medical care, accessible rural credit, higher minimum wages and generous price floors for agricultural goods. At one point in his sister’s tenure, a tonne of rice brought in as much as 20,000 baht ($625). It now fetches 8,000 baht, thanks to the fall in global prices and the removal of the government’s price floor. “If the government does not pay more, what can we do?” asks Anong Wannasupring, a farmer. For all of its waste and corruption, the Shinawatra style of clientilistic mass politics helped to spread spending power to the poorer regions, where local bigwigs doled out funds disbursed from the central government. All that has changed under the junta, which has kept a firmer grip on the purse-strings. The National Village Community Fund, which has allocated 500,000 baht each to almost 80,000 villages for rural projects, is now administered by the ministry of interior. The state’s Special Financial Institutions, which provide rural credit, are now regulated by the central bank, having previously been the playthings of provincial politicians. These days, if you wait for money from Bangkok, “you’ll wait forever,” says Mr Suradech. His complaint is confirmed by a startling calculation. The World Bank reckons that over 70% of Thailand’s public expenditure in 2010 benefited Greater Bangkok, home to 17% of the country’s population. In no other economy with a comparable level of income is government spending as skewed, say the bank’s economists. Rather than lift the shopping power of the rural masses, the junta has aimed to boost spending by tourists and urbanites. It has cut taxes markedly for the relatively few businesses and people that pay them. It has also succeeded in doubling the number of visitors from China to 10m a year. Bangkok’s efforts to claw back fiscal decision-making may curb clientelism. But this reconcentration of power may also result in a reconcentration of prosperity. The renewed centrality of “one man in Bangkok”, says Ms Nongpetch, the used-car dealer, has been bad for business.

AN ABRIDGED ROLL CALL FOR 1942 1. The desperate Jews—their spirits in my lap as we sat on the roof, next to the steaming chimneys. 2. The Russian soldiers—taking only small amounts of ammunition, relying on the fallen for the rest of it. 3. The soaked bodies of a French coast— beached on the shingle and sand.

When they arrived in full, the noise of their feet throbbed on top of the road. Their eyes were enormous in their starving skulls. And the dirt. The dirt was molded to them. Their legs staggered as they were pushed by soldiers’ hands—a few wayward steps of forced running before the slow return to a malnourished walk.

It’s probably fair to say that in all the years of Hitler’s reign, no person was able to serve the Führer as loyally as me. A human doesn’t have a heart like mine. The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time. The consequence of this is that I’m always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both. Still, they have one thing I envy. Humans, if nothing else, have the good sense to die.

Again, I offer you a glimpse of the end. Perhaps it’s to soften the blow for later, or to better prepare myself for the telling. Either way, I must inform you that it was raining on Himmel Street when the world ended for Liesel Meminger. The sky was dripping. Like a tap that a child has tried its hardest to turn off but hasn’t quite managed. The first drops were cool. I felt them on my hands as I stood outside Frau Diller’s. Above me, I could hear them. Through the overcast sky, I looked up and saw the tin-can planes. I watched their stomachs open and the bombs drop casually out. They were off target, of course. They were often off target.

Years ago, when they’d raced on a muddy field, Rudy was a hastily assembled set of bones, with a jagged, rocky smile. In the trees this afternoon, he was a giver of bread and teddy bears. He was a triple Hitler Youth athletics champion. He was her best friend. And he was a month from his death. “Of course I told him about you,” Liesel said. She was saying goodbye and she didn’t even know it.

Make no mistake, the woman had a heart. She had a bigger one than people would think. There was a lot in it, stored up, high in miles of hidden shelving. Remember that she was the woman with the instrument strapped to her body in the long, moon-slit night. She was a Jew feeder without a question in the world on a man’s first night in Molching. And she was an arm reacher, deep into a mattress, to deliver a sketchbook to a teenage girl.

There was much work to be done, and with a collection of other materials, The Book Thief was stepped on several times and eventually picked up without even a glance and thrown aboard a garbage truck. Just before the truck left, I climbed quickly up and took it in my hand. . . . It’s lucky I was there. Then again, who am I kidding? I’m in most places at least once, and in 1943, I was just about everywhere.

And indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes, “followed the sea” with reverence and affection, that to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and untitled—the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from the GOLDEN HIND returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure, to be visited by the Queen’s Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to the EREBUS and TERROR, bound on other conquests—and that never returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith—the adventurers and the settlers; kings’ ships and the ships of men on ’Change; captains, admirals, the dark “interlopers” of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned “generals” of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth! . . . The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires.

He was a seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home order, and their home is always with them—the ship; and so is their country—the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is always the same.

It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind—as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much.

Suddenly, now, I know what I want. I want the counselors to build a pyre…and let my ashes drop and mingle with the sand. Lose my bones amongst the driftwood, my teeth amongst the sand….I don’t believe in the wisdom of children, nor in the wisdom of the old. There is a moment, a cusp, when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.

I had come to see language as an almost supernatural force, existing between people, bringing our brains, shielded in centimeter-thick skulls, into communion. A word meant something only between people, and life’s meaning, its virtue, had something to do with the depth of the relationships we form. It was the relational aspect of humans—i.e., “human relationality”—that undergirded meaning. Yet somehow, this process existed in brains and bodies, subject to their own physiologic imperatives, prone to breaking and failing. There must be a way, I thought, that the language of life as experienced—of passion, of hunger, of love—bore some relationship, however convoluted, to the language of neurons, digestive tracts, and heartbeats.

In anatomy lab, we objectified the dead, literally reducing them to organs, tissues, nerves, muscles. On that first day, you simply could not deny the humanity of the corpse. But by the time you’d skinned the limbs, sliced through inconvenient muscles, pulled out the lungs, cut open the heart, and removed a lobe of the liver, it was hard to recognize this pile of tissue as human. Anatomy lab, in the end, becomes less a violation of the sacred and more something that interferes with happy hour, and that realization discomfits. In our rare reflective moments, we were all silently apologizing to our cadavers, not because we sensed the transgression but because we did not.

It was becoming clear that learning to be a doctor in practice was going to be a very different education from being a medical student in the classroom.

As my skills increased, so too did my responsibility. Learning to judge whose lives could be saved, whose couldn’t be, and whose shouldn’t be requires an unattainable prognostic ability. I made mistakes. Rushing a patient to the OR to save only enough brain that his heart beats but he can never speak, he eats through a tube, and he is condemned to an existence he would never want…I came to see this as a more egregious failure than the patient dying. The twilight existence of unconscious metabolism becomes an unbearable burden, usually left to an institution, where the family, unable to attain closure, visits with increasing rarity, until the inevitable fatal bedsore or pneumonia sets in. Some insist on this life and embrace its possibility, eyes open. But many do not, or cannot, and the neurosurgeon must learn to adjudicate.

I had to help those families understand that the person they knew—the full, vital independent human—now lived only in the past and that I needed their input to understand what sort of future he or she would want: an easy death or to be strung between bags of fluids going in, others coming out, to persist despite being unable to struggle.

Before operating on a patient’s brain, I realized, I must first understand his mind: his identity, his values, what makes his life worth living, and what devastation makes it reasonable to let that life end. The cost of my dedication to succeed was high, and the ineluctable failures brought me nearly unbearable guilt. Those burdens are what make medicine holy and wholly impossible: in taking up another’s cross, one must sometimes get crushed by the weight.

Death comes for all of us. For us, for our patients: it is our fate as living, breathing, metabolizing organisms. Most lives are lived with passivity toward death—it’s something that happens to you and those around you.

Our patients’ lives and identities may be in our hands, yet death always wins. Even if you are perfect, the world isn’t. The secret is to know that the deck is stacked, that you will lose, that your hands or judgment will slip, and yet still struggle to win for your patients. You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.

My carefully planned and hard-won future no longer existed. Death, so familiar to me in my work, was now paying a personal visit. Here we were, finally face-to-face, and yet nothing about it seemed recognizable. Standing at the crossroads where I should have been able to see and follow the footprints of the countless patients I had treated over the years, I saw instead only a blank, a harsh, vacant, gleaming white desert, as if a sandstorm had erased all trace of familiarity.

I had passed from the subject to the direct object of every sentence of my life. In fourteenth-century philosophy, the word patient simply meant “the object of an action,” and I felt like one. As a doctor, I was an agent, a cause; as a patient, I was merely something to which things happened.

felt that life wasn’t about avoiding suffering. Years ago, it had occurred to me that Darwin and Nietzsche agreed on one thing: the defining characteristic of the organism is striving.

I looked forward to the chance to reconnect with my former self. Yet being there merely heightened the surreal contrast of what my life was now. I was surrounded by success and possibility and ambition, by peers and seniors whose lives were running along a trajectory that was no longer mine, whose bodies could still tolerate standing for a grueling eight-hour surgery. I felt trapped inside a reversed Christmas carol: Victoria was opening the happy present—grants, job offers, publications—I should be sharing. My senior peers were living the future that was no longer mine: early career awards, promotions, new houses.

I got out of bed and took a step forward, repeating the phrase over and over: “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.” That morning, I made a decision: I would push myself to return to the OR. Why?

The tricky part of illness is that, as you go through it, your values are constantly changing. You try to figure out what matters to you, and then you keep figuring it out. It felt like someone had taken away my credit card and I was having to learn how to budget. You may decide you want to spend your time working as a neurosurgeon, but two months later, you may feel differently.

| Next | Section Menu | Main Menu | Previous | Geography lessons Where immigrants go to school is more important than where they came from Immigrant children’s performance varies widely Dec 10th 2016 IF YOU think starting a new school is scary stuff—try doing it in a new country. Migrants can face a twin disadvantage. They are often concentrated in struggling schools. And, at least at first, they may suffer from having to toggle between languages at home and in class. Two-thirds of pupils born outside their host country use another tongue at home. Nearly one in two second-generation immigrants does so. It is little wonder that many migrants struggle on the latest Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests. The children of foreign-born parents are on average about a year behind their peers, even after accounting for parental income. This finding hides a lot of variation (see chart). In Australia and Canada pupils whose parents were born abroad do better on science tests than similar teenagers with native-born parents. Meanwhile immigrants in European countries are often far behind. In Germany first-generation and second-generation migrants are respectively about 2.5 and 1.5 years behind teenagers with German-born parents, even after accounting for their different economic backgrounds. There are similar results in Finland, a country often lauded for its record of equality in education. For sure, migrants’ origins matter a lot. Second-generation East Asian pupils in Australia are roughly 2.5 years ahead of those with native-born parents. They do even better than pupils in Singapore, the highest-performing country in PISA, even as results in Australia as a whole have fallen. Yet the country in which the immigrant attends school is more important than the one he comes from, says the OECD’s Andreas Schleicher. Turkish-born pupils in Germany are nearly two years behind in science tests compared with those in the Netherlands, after adjusting for different economic backgrounds. Policy makes a difference. Attending nursery or extra language tuition helps migrants catch up. Limiting selection by academic ability gives them more time to make up ground. Not making them repeat a year has the same effect. Admissions policies matter, too. Avoiding high concentrations of migrants in particular schools would help their academic achievement. It would probably also help poorer native children. The task of educating migrants better is urgent, especially in Europe. The share of children of foreign-born parents in the OECD that took PISA increased from 9.4% in 2006 to 12.5% in 2015. It could rise further in light of the numbers of migrants settling in Europe in 2015 and 2016. A survey last year by the OECD found that about 80% of second-generation immigrants feel at home at school. But outliers should cause concern. In France, for example, just 40% of second-generation immigrants say they feel as if they belong in school. That is a figure to make everyone in the country sit up straight.

In the end, it cannot be doubted that each of us can see only a part of the picture. The doctor sees one, the patient another, the engineer a third, the economist a fourth, the pearl diver a fifth, the alcoholic a sixth, the cable guy a seventh, the sheep farmer an eighth, the Indian beggar a ninth, the pastor a tenth. Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete. And Truth comes somewhere above all of them, where, as at the end of that Sunday’s reading, the sower and reaper can rejoice together. For here the saying is verified that “One sows and another reaps.” I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the work, and you are sharing the fruits of their work.

Part of the cruelty of cancer, though, is not only that it limits your time; it also limits your energy, vastly reducing the amount you can squeeze into a day. It is a tired hare who now races. And even if I had the energy, I prefer a more tortoiselike approach. I plod, I ponder. Some days, I simply persist.

Cady rubbed her eyes with chubby fists as her bedtime approached, and a family friend arrived to take her home.

Softly I sang Cady’s bedtime song, to her, to both of them, and then released her.

I agreed with George, and suggested that we should seek out some retired and old-world spot, far from the madding crowd, and dream away a sunny week among its drowsy lanes—some half-forgotten nook, hidden away by the fairies, out of reach of the noisy world—some quaint-perched eyrie on the cliffs of Time, from whence the surging waves of the nineteenth century would sound far-off and faint.

I remember my brother-in-law going for a short sea trip once, for the benefit of his health.  He took a return berth from London to Liverpool; and when he got to Liverpool, the only thing he was anxious about was to sell that return ticket. It was offered round the town at a tremendous reduction, so I am told; and was eventually sold for eighteenpence to a bilious-looking youth who had just been advised by his medical men to go to the sea-side, and take exercise.

“Sea-side!” said my brother-in-law, pressing the ticket affectionately into his hand; “why, you’ll have enough to last you a lifetime; and as for exercise! why, you’ll get more exercise, sitting down on that ship, than you would turning somersaults on dry land.”

Slowly the golden memory of the dead sun fades from the hearts of the cold, sad clouds.  Silent, like sorrowing children, the birds have ceased their song, and only the moorhen’s plaintive cry and the harsh croak of the corncrake stirs the awed hush around the couch of waters, where the dying day breathes out her last. From the dim woods on either bank, Night’s ghostly army, the grey shadows, creep out with noiseless tread to chase away the lingering rear-guard of the light, and pass, with noiseless, unseen feet, above the waving river-grass, and through the sighing rushes; and Night, upon her sombre throne, folds her black wings above the darkening world, and, from her phantom palace, lit by the pale stars, reigns in stillness.

From the Grand Principality of Muscovy, through Peter the Great, Stalin, and now Putin, each Russian leader has been confronted by the same problems. It doesn’t matter if the ideology of those in control is czarist, Communist, or crony capitalist—the ports still freeze, and the North European Plain is still flat. Strip out the lines of nation states, and the map Ivan the Terrible confronted is the same one Vladimir Putin is faced with to this day.

If it can avoid a serious conflict with Japan or the United States, then the only real danger to China is itself. There are 1.4 billion reasons why China may succeed, and 1.4 billion reasons why it may not surpass America as the greatest power in the world. A great depression such as in the 1930s could set it back decades. China has locked itself into the global economy. If we don’t buy, they don’t make. And if they don’t make, there will be mass unemployment. If there is mass and long-term unemployment, in an age when the Chinese are a people packed into urban areas, the inevitable social unrest could be—like everything else in modern China—on a scale hitherto unseen.

In 1803, the United States simply bought control of the entire Louisiana Territory from France. The land stretched from the Gulf of Mexico northwest up to the headwaters of the tributaries of the Mississippi River in the Rocky Mountains. It was an area equivalent in size to modern-day Spain, Italy, France, the UK, and Germany combined. With it came the Mississippi basin, from which flowed America’s route to greatness. At the stroke of a pen, and the handing over of $15 million, the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 doubled the size of the United States and gave it mastery over the greatest inland water transport route in the world. As the American historian Henry Adams wrote, “Never did the United States get so much for so little.”

The Louisiana Purchase had given the United States the heartland, but the Transcontinental Treaty of 1819 gave them something almost as valuable. The Spanish accepted that the US would have jurisdiction in the far west above the 42nd parallel on what is now the border of California and Oregon while Spain would control what lay below, west of the American territories. The United States had reached the Pacific. At the time, most Americans thought the great victory of 1819 was getting Florida, but Secretary of State John Quincy Adams wrote in his diary: “The acquisition of a definite line of boundary to the [Pacific] forms a great epoch in our history.”

While the infiltration of Texas was going on, Washington, DC, issued the Monroe Doctrine (named after President James Monroe) in 1823, which boiled down to warning the European powers that they could no longer seek land in the Western Hemisphere, and that if they lost any parts of their existing territory they could not reclaim them. Or else.

The Texas Revolution of 1835–36 drove the Mexicans out, but it was a close-run thing, and had the settlers lost then, the Mexican army would have been in a position to march on New Orleans and control the southern end of the Mississippi. It is one of the great what-ifs of modern history. However, history turned the other way and Texas became independent, via American money, arms, and ideas. The territory went on to join the Union in 1845 and together they fought the 1846–48 Mexican War, in which they crushed their southern neighbor, which was required to accept that Mexico ended in the sands of the southern bank of the Rio Grande.

In 1867, Alaska was bought from Russia. At the time it was known as “Seward’s Folly,” named for the secretary of state, William Seward, who agreed to the deal. He paid $7.2 million, or two cents, an acre. The press accused him of purchasing snow, but minds were changed with the discovery of gold in 1896. Decades later, huge reserves of oil were also found. Two years on, in 1869, came the opening of the transcontinental railroad. Now you could cross the country in a week, whereas it had previously taken several hazardous months.

They assumed people would want to come together, whereas in fact many dare not try and would prefer to live apart because of their experiences.

There had been the “idea” of Germany for centuries: the Eastern Frankish lands, which became the Holy Roman Empire in the tenth century, were sometimes called “the Germanies,” comprising as they did up to five hundred Germanic mini-kingdoms. After it was dissolved in 1806, the German Confederation of thirty-nine statelets came together in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna. This in turn led to the North German Confederation, and then the unification of Germany in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War, in which victorious German troops occupied Paris.

Most of the continent’s rivers also pose a problem, as they begin in highland and descend in abrupt drops that thwart navigation. For example, the mighty Zambezi may be Africa’s fourth-longest river, running for 1,700 miles, and may be a stunning tourist attraction with its white-water rapids and the Victoria Falls, but as a trade route it is of little use. It flows through six countries, dropping from 4,900 feet to sea level when it reaches the Indian Ocean at Mozambique. Parts of it are navigable by shallow boats, but these parts do not interconnect, thus limiting the transportation of cargo.

The continent’s great rivers—the Niger, the Congo, the Zambezi, the Nile, and others—don’t connect, and this disconnection has a human factor. Whereas huge areas of Russia, China, and the United States speak a unifying language, which helps trade, in Africa thousands of languages exist and no one culture emerged to dominate areas of similar size. Europe, on the other hand, was small enough to have a lingua franca through which to communicate, and a landscape that encouraged interaction.

The exchange of ideas and technology barely touched sub-Saharan Africa for thousands of years. Despite this, several African empires and city states did arise after about the sixth century CE: for example the Mali Empire (thirteenth to sixteenth century), and the city state of Great Zimbabwe (eleventh to fifteenth century), the latter in land around the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. However, these and others were isolated to relatively small regional blocs, and although the myriad cultures that did emerge across the continent may have been politically sophisticated, the physical landscape remained a barrier to technological development: by the time the outside world arrived in force, most had yet to develop writing, paper, gunpowder, or the wheel.

By the ninth century, they had crossed the Sahara, and by the eleventh were firmly established as far south as modern-day Nigeria.

Traders in the Sahel region used thousands of slaves to transport vast quantities of the region’s then most valuable commodity—salt—but the Arabs began the practice of subcontracting African slave–taking to willing tribal leaders who would deliver them to the coast. By the time of the peak of the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, hundreds of thousands of Africans (mostly from the Sudan region) had been taken to Istanbul, Cairo, Damascus, and across the Arabian world. The Europeans followed suit, outdoing the Arabs and Turks in their appetite for, and mistreatment of, the people brought to the slave ships anchored off the west coast.

The European colonialists created an egg without a chicken, a logical absurdity repeated across the continent and one that continues to haunt it.

Chinese involvement is an attractive proposition for many African governments. Beijing and the big Chinese companies don’t ask difficult questions about human rights, and they don’t demand economic reform or even suggest that certain African leaders stop stealing their countries’ wealth, as the IMF or World Bank might. For example, China is Sudan’s biggest trading partner, which goes some way to explaining why China consistently protects Sudan at the UN Security Council and continued to back its President Omar al-Bashir even when there was an arrest warrant out for him issued by the International Criminal Court. Western criticism of this gets short shrift in Beijing, however; it is regarded as simply another power play aimed at stopping China from doing business, and hypocrisy, given the West’s history in Africa. Lecturing the African leaders is going out of fashion due to the harsh realities of global economic competition and the threat of Islamism

Because it is located so far south, and the coastal plain quickly rises into highland, South Africa is one of the very few African countries that do not suffer from the curse of malaria, as mosquitoes find it difficult to breed there. This allowed the European colonialists to push into its interior much farther and faster than in the malaria-riddled tropics, settle, and begin small-scale industrial activity that grew into what is now southern Africa’s biggest economy.

When the Ottoman Empire began to collapse, the British and French had a different idea. In 1916, the British diplomat Colonel Sir Mark Sykes took a grease pencil and drew a crude line across a map of the Middle East. It ran from Haifa on the Mediterranean in what is now Israel to Kirkuk (now in Iraq) in the northeast. It became the basis of his secret agreement with his French counterpart François Georges-Picot to divide the region into two spheres of influence should the Triple Entente defeat the Ottoman Empire in the First World War. North of the line was to be under French control, south of it under British hegemony. The term Sykes-Picot has become shorthand for the various decisions made in the first third of the twentieth century, which betrayed promises given to tribal leaders and which partially explains the unrest and extremism of today. This explanation can be overstated, though: there was violence and extremism before the Europeans arrived.

Shia Islam has three main divisions, the best known of which is probably the Twelvers, who adhere to the teaching of the twelve imams, but even that contains divisions. The Ismaili school disputes the lineage of the seventh imam, while the Zaidi school disputes that of the fifth imam. There are also several offshoots from mainstream Shia Islam, with the Alawites and Druze being considered so far away from traditional Islamic thought that many other Muslims, especially among the Sunni, do not even recognize them as being part of the religion.

The legacy of European colonialism left the Arabs grouped into nation states and ruled by leaders who tended to favor whichever branch of Islam (and tribe) from which they themselves came. These dictators then used the machinery of state to ensure their writ ruled over the entire area within the artificial lines drawn by the Europeans, regardless of whether this was historically appropriate and fair to the different tribes and religions that had been thrown together.

smallest minorities in a dictatorship will sometimes pretend to believe the propaganda that their rights are protected because they lack the strength to do anything about the reality. For example, Iraq’s Christian minority, and its handful of Jews, felt they might be safer keeping quiet in a secular dictatorship, such as Saddam’s, than risk change and what they feared might follow, and indeed has followed. However, the Kurds were geographically defined and, crucially, numerous enough to be able to react when the reality of dictatorship became too much.

The 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States cemented what appears to be a fact—Baghdad will not again rule the Kurds.

When the French ruled the region they followed the British example of divide and rule. At that time, the Alawites were known as Nusayris. Many Sunnis do not count them as Muslims, and such was the hostility toward them that they rebranded themselves as Alawites, as in “followers of Ali” to reinforce their Islamic credentials. They were a backward hill people, at the bottom of the social strata in Syrian society. The French took them and put them into the police force and military, from where, over the years, they established themselves as a major power in the land. Fundamentally, everyone was aware of the tension of having leaders from a small minority of the population ruling the majority. The Assad clan, from which President Bashar al-Assad comes, is Alawite, which comprises approximately 12 percent of the population. The family has ruled the country since Bashar’s father, Hafez, took power in a coup d’état in 1970.

Groups such as al-Qaeda and, more recently, the Islamic State have garnered what support they have partially because of the humiliation caused by colonialism and then the failure of pan-Arab nationalism—and to an extent the Arab nation state. Arab leaders have failed to deliver prosperity or freedom, and the siren call of Islamism, which promises to solve all problems, has proved attractive to many in a region marked by a toxic mix of piety, unemployment, and repression. The Islamists hark back to a golden age when Islam ruled an empire and was at the cutting edge of technology, art, medicine, and government. They have helped bring to the surface the ancient suspicions of “the other” throughout the Middle East.

It is an acronym of sorts for the Arabic Dawlat al-Islamiya f’al-Iraq wa al-Shams, but the reason people came up with the name is because the Islamic State members hate the term. It sounds similar to the word daes—one who is underhanded and sows dissent. More important, it rhymes with negative words such as fahish—“sinner”—and best of all, for those who despise the organization’s particular brand of Islam, is that it rhymes with and sounds a bit like jahesh—“stupid ass.” This is worse than being called a donkey, because in Arab culture one of the few things more stupid than a donkey is an ass.

The Jews agreed, the Arabs said no. The outcome was war, which created the first wave of Palestinian refugees fleeing the area and Jewish refugees coming in from across the Middle East.

During the Six-Day War of 1967, the Israelis won control of all of Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza. In 2005, they left Gaza, but hundreds of thousands of settlers remain in the West Bank. Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal, indivisible capital. The Jewish religion says the rock upon which Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac is there, and that it stands directly above the Holy of Holies, King Solomon’s Temple. For the Palestinians, Jerusalem has a religious resonance that runs deep throughout the Muslim world: the city is regarded as the third most holy place in Islam because the prophet Muhammad is said to have ascended to heaven from that same rock, which is on the site of what is now the “Farthest Mosque” (Al-Aqsa). Militarily, the city is of only moderate strategic geographical importance—it has no real industry to speak of, no river, and no airport—but it is of overwhelming significance in cultural and religious terms: the ideological need for the place is of more importance than its location. Control of, and access to, Jerusalem is not an issue upon which a compromise solution can be easily achieved.

At its narrowest point, the Strait, which is regarded as the most strategic in the world, is only twenty-one miles across. The industrialized world fears the effect of Hormuz being closed possibly for months on end, with ensuing spiraling prices. This is one reason why so many countries pressure Israel not to act.

After the victorious powers carved up Turkey, he rose to become president on a platform of resisting the terms imposed by the Allies, but at the same time modernizing Turkey and making it part of Europe. Western legal codes and the Gregorian calendar were introduced and Islamic public institutions banned. The wearing of the fez was forbidden, the Latin alphabet replaced Arabic script, and he even granted the vote to women (two years ahead of Spain and fifteen years ahead of France).

Anti-Semitic cartoons that echo the Nazi Der Stürmer propaganda newspaper are common. Week in, week out, shock-jock imams are given space on prime-time TV shows. Western apologists for this sort of behavior are sometimes hamstrung by a fear of being described as one of Edward Said’s “Orientalists.” They betray their own liberal values by denying their universality. Others, in their naïveté, say that these incitements to murder are not widespread and must be seen in the context of the Arabic language, which can be given to flights of rhetoric. This signals their lack of understanding of the “Arab street,” the role of the mainstream Arab media, and a refusal to understand that when people who are full of hatred say something, they mean it.

The founding story of Korea is that it was created in 2333 BCE by heavenly design. The Lord of Heaven sent his son Hwanung down to earth, where he descended to the Paektu Mountain and married a woman who used to be a bear, and their son, Dangun, went on to engage in an early example of nation building. The earliest recorded version of this creation legend dates from the thirteenth century. It may in some ways explain why a Communist state has a leadership that is passed down through one family and given divine status.

The choice of the 38th parallel as the line of division was unfortunate in many ways and, according to historian Don Oberdorfer, arbitrary. He says that Washington was so focused on the Japanese surrender on August 10 that it had no real strategy for Korea. With Soviet troops on the move in the north of the peninsula and the White House convening an all-night emergency meeting, two junior officers, armed only with a National Geographic map, chose the 38th parallel as a place to suggest to the Soviets they halt, on the grounds that it was halfway down the country. No Koreans were present, nor any Korea experts. If they had been, they could have told President Truman and his secretary of state James Byrnes that the line was the same one that the Russians and Japanese had discussed for spheres of influence half a century earlier, following the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–5. Moscow, not knowing that the Americans were making up policy on the fly, could be forgiven for thinking this was the United States’s de facto recognition of that suggestion and therefore acceptance of division and a Communist north. The deal was done, the nation divided, and the die cast. The Soviets pulled their troops out of the north in 1948 and the Americans followed suit in the south in 1949.

Opinions differ about when the islands became Japan, but there is a famous letter sent from what we know as Japan to the Emperor of China in 617 CE in which a Japanese leading nobleman writes: “Here I the emperor of the country where the sun rises send a letter to the emperor of the country where the sun sets. Are you healthy?” History records that the Chinese emperor took a dim view of such perceived impertinence. His empire was vast, while the main Japanese islands were still only loosely united, a situation that would not change until approximately the sixteenth century.

It had limited and poor-quality supplies of coal, very little oil, scant quantities of natural gas, limited supplies of rubber, and a shortage of many metals. This is as true now as it was one hundred years ago, although offshore gas fields are being explored along with those of underwater precious metals. Nevertheless, it remains the world’s largest importer of natural gas, and the third-largest importer of oil. It was the thirst for these products, notably iron and oil, that caused Japan to rampage across the far-less developed Southeast Asia in the 1930s and early ’40s. It had already occupied Taiwan in 1895 and followed this up with the annexation of Korea in 1910. Japan occupied Manchuria in 1931, then conducted a full-scale invasion of China in 1937. As each domino fell, the expanding empire and the growing Japanese population required more oil, more coal, more metal, more rubber, and more food.

the European settlers introduced another geographical problem that to this day holds many countries back from developing their full potential: they stayed near the coasts, especially (as we saw in Africa) in regions where the interior was infested by mosquitoes and disease. Most of the countries’ biggest cities, often the capitals, were therefore near the coasts, and all roads from the interior were developed to connect to the capitals but not to one another.

Academics and journalists are fond of writing that the continent is “at a crossroads”—as in about to embark at last on its great future. I would argue that geographically speaking, it is less at a crossroads than at the bottom of the world; there’s a lot going on all over this vast space, but the problem is much of it is going on a long way from anywhere other than itself. That may be considered a Northern Hemispheric view, but it is also a view of where the major economic, military, and diplomatic powers are situated.

Particularly bitter is the relationship between Bolivia and Chile, which dates back to the 1879 War of the Pacific in which Bolivia lost a large chunk of its territory, including 250 miles of coastline, and has been landlocked ever since. It has never recovered from this blow, which partially explains why it is among the poorest Latin American countries. This in turn has exacerbated the severe divide between the mostly European lowlands population and the mostly indigenous peoples of the highlands.

In 1513, the Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa had to sail across the Atlantic, land in what is now Panama, then trek through jungles and over mountains before seeing another vast ocean—the Pacific. The advantages of linking them were obvious, but it was another 401 years before technology caught up with geography. In 1914, the newly built, fifty-mile-long, American-controlled Panama Canal opened, thus saving ships an eight-thousand-mile journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and leading to economic growth in the canal region. Since 1999, the canal has been controlled by Panama, but is regarded as a neutral international waterway that is safeguarded by the US and Panama navies. And therein, for the Chinese, lies a problem.

China, as we saw in chapter two, has designs on being a global power, and to achieve this aim it will need to keep sea-lanes open for its commerce and its navy. The Panama Canal may well be a neutral passageway, but at the end of the day, passage through it is dependent on American goodwill. So, why not build your own canal up the road in Nicaragua? After all, what’s $50 billion to a growing superpower? The Nicaragua Grand Canal project is funded by a Hong Kong businessman named Wang Jing, who has made a lot of money in telecommunications but has no experience in engineering, let alone masterminding one of the most ambitious construction projects in the history of the world. Mr. Wang is adamant that the Chinese government not be involved in the project. Given the nature of China’s business culture and the participation of its government in all aspects of life, this is unusual.

This is among the most valuable pieces of real estate on the whole continent. It immediately gave Argentina an economic and strategic advantage over Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay—one it holds to this day. However, Argentina has not always used its advantages to the fullest. A hundred years ago it was among the ten richest countries in the world—ahead of France and Italy. But a failure to diversify, a stratified and unfair society, a poor education system, a succession of coups d’état, and the wildly differing economic policies in the democratic period of the last thirty years has seen a sharp decline in Argentina’s status.

Sir William Edward Parry, minus a GPS, tried in 1827, but the ice was moving south faster than he could move north and he ended up going backward; but he did at least survive. Captain Sir John Franklin had less luck when he attempted to cross the last non-navigated section of the Northwest Passage in 1848. His two ships became stuck in the ice near King William Island in the Canadian archipelago. All 129 members of the expedition perished, some on board the ships, others after they abandoned the vessels and began walking south. Several expeditions were sent to search for survivors, but they found only a handful of skeletons and heard stories from Inuit hunters about dozens of white men who had died walking through the frozen landscape. The ships had vanished completely, but in 2014, technology caught up with geography and a Canadian search team using sonar located one of the vessels, HMS Erebus, on the seabed of the Northwest Passage and brought up the ship’s bell.

The melting of the ice cap already allows cargo ships to make the journey through the Northwest Passage in the Canadian archipelago for several summer weeks a year, thus cutting at least a week from the transit time from Europe to China. The first cargo ship not to be escorted by an icebreaker went through in 2014. The Nunavik carried twenty-three thousand tons of nickel ore from Canada to China. The polar route was 40 percent shorter and used deeper waters than if it had gone through the Panama Canal. This allowed the ship to carry more cargo, save tens of thousands of dollars in fuel costs, and reduced the ship’s greenhouse emissions by 1,300 metric tons. By 2040, the route is expected to be open for up to two months each year, transforming trade links across the High North and causing knock-on effects as far away as Egypt and Panama in terms of the revenues they enjoy from the Suez and Panama Canals.

The Russians know that NATO can bottle up their Baltic Fleet by blockading the Skagerrak Strait. This potential blockade is complicated by the fact that up in the Arctic their Northern Fleet has only 180 miles of open water from the Kola coastline until it hits the Arctic ice pack. From this narrow corridor it must also come down through the Norwegian Sea and then run the potential gauntlet of the GIUK gap to reach the Atlantic Ocean. During the Cold War, the area was known by NATO as the Kill Zone, as this was where NATO’s planes, ships, and submarines expected to catch the Soviet fleet.

Elevens. It seemed a short time ago that Jonas had undergone the Ceremony of Eleven, but he remembered that it was not one of the more interesting ones. By Eleven, one was only waiting to be Twelve. It was simply a marking of time with no meaningful changes. There was new clothing: different undergarments for the females, whose bodies were beginning to change; and longer trousers for the males, with a specially shaped pocket for the small calculator that they would use this year in school; but those were simply presented in wrapped packages without an accompanying speech.

most countries have introduced free-market policies over the last three decades – privatization of state-owned industrial and financial firms, deregulation of finance and industry, liberalization of international trade and investment, and reduction in income taxes and welfare payments. These policies, their advocates admitted, may temporarily create some problems, such as rising inequality, but ultimately they will make everyone better off by creating a more dynamic and wealthier society.

Being critical of free-market ideology is not the same as being against capitalism. Despite its problems and limitations, I believe that capitalism is still the best economic system that humanity has invented. My criticism is of a particular version of capitalism that has dominated the world in the last three decades, that is, free-market capitalism. This is not the only way to run capitalism, and certainly not the best, as the record of the last three decades shows. The book shows that there are ways in which capitalism should, and can, be made better.

Thus seen, the ‘freedom’ of a market is, like beauty, in the eyes of the beholder. If you believe that the right of children not to have to work is more important than the right of factory owners to be able to hire whoever they find most profitable, you will not see a ban on child labour as an infringement on the freedom of the labour market. If you believe the opposite, you will see an ‘unfree’ market, shackled by a misguided government regulation.

If the same market can be perceived to have varying degrees of freedom by different people, there is really no objective way to define how free that market is. In other words, the free market is an illusion. If some markets look free, it is only because we so totally accept the regulations that are propping them up that they become invisible.

Wages in rich countries are determined more by immigration control than anything else, including any minimum wage legislation. How is the immigration maximum determined? Not by the ‘free’ labour market, which, if left alone, will end up replacing 80–90 per cent of native workers with cheaper, and often more productive, immigrants. Immigration is largely settled by politics. So, if you have any residual doubt about the massive role that the government plays in the economy’s free market, then pause to reflect that all our wages are, at root, politically determined

This clash of values also lies behind the contemporary debate on free trade vs. fair trade. Many Americans believe that China is engaged in international trade that may be free but is not fair. In their view, by paying workers unacceptably low wages and making them work in inhumane conditions, China competes unfairly. The Chinese, in turn, can riposte that it is unacceptable that rich countries, while advocating free trade, try to impose artificial barriers to China’s exports by attempting to restrict the import of ‘sweatshop’ products. They find it unjust to be prevented from exploiting the only resource they have in greatest abundance – cheap labour.

Until the beginning of the twentieth century, the average work week in the US was around sixty hours. At the time (in 1905, to be more precise), it was a country in which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a New York state law limiting the working days of bakers to ten hours, on the grounds that it ‘deprived the baker of the liberty of working as long as he wished’. Thus seen, the debate about fair trade is essentially about moral values and political decisions, and not economics in the usual sense. Even though it is about an economic issue, it is not something economists with their technical tool kits are particularly well equipped to rule on.

Recognizing that the boundaries of the market are ambiguous and cannot be determined in an objective way lets us realize that economics is not a science like physics or chemistry, but a political exercise. Free-market economists may want you to believe that the correct boundaries of the market can be scientifically determined, but this is incorrect. If the boundaries of what you are studying cannot be scientifically determined, what you are doing is not a science.

So, when free-market economists say that a certain regulation should not be introduced because it would restrict the ‘freedom’ of a certain market, they are merely expressing a political opinion that they reject the rights that are to be defended by the proposed law. Their ideological cloak is to pretend that their politics is not really political, but rather is an objective economic truth, while other people’s politics is political. However, they are as politically motivated as their opponents. Breaking away from the illusion of market objectivity is the first step towards understanding capitalism.

Before the invention of the limited liability company in sixteenth-century Europe – or the joint-stock company, as it was known in its early days – businessmen had to risk everything when they started a venture. When I say everything, I really mean everything – not just personal property (unlimited liability meant that a failed businessman had to sell all his personal properties to repay all the debts) but also personal freedom (they could go to a debtors’ prison, should they fail to honour their debts). Given this, it is almost a miracle that anyone was willing to start a business at all.

even after the invention of limited liability, it was in practice very difficult to use it until the mid nineteenth century – you needed a royal charter in order to set up a limited liability company (or a government charter in a republic). It was believed that those who were managing a limited liability company without owning it 100 per cent would take excessive risks, because part of the money they were risking was not their own. At the same time, the non-managing investors in a limited liability company would also become less vigilant in monitoring the managers, as their risks were capped (at their respective investments).

Adam Smith, the father of economics and the patron saint of free-market capitalism, opposed limited liability on these grounds. He famously said that the ‘directors of [joint stock] companies . . . being the managers rather of other people’s money than of their own, it cannot well be expected that they would watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery [i.e., partnership, which demands unlimited liability] frequently watch over their own’.[2]

in defending the ‘new’ capitalism against its free-market critics, Marx had an ulterior motive. He thought the joint-stock company was a ‘point of transition’ to socialism in that it separated ownership from management, thereby making it possible to eliminate capitalists (who now do not manage the firm) without jeopardizing the material progress that capitalism had achieved.

in the 1980s, the holy grail was found. It was called the principle of shareholder value maximization. It was argued that professional managers should be rewarded according to the amount they can give to shareholders. In order to achieve this, it was argued, first profits need to be maximized by ruthlessly cutting costs – wage bills, investments, inventories, middle-level managers, and so on. Second, the highest possible share of these profits needs to be distributed to the shareholders – through dividends and share buybacks. In order to encourage managers to behave in this way, the proportion of their compensation packages that stock options account for needs to be increased, so that they identify more with the interests of the shareholders. The idea was advocated not just by shareholders, but also by many professional managers, most famously by Jack Welch, the long-time chairman of General Electric (GE), who is often credited with coining the term ‘shareholder value’ in a speech in 1981.

this unholy alliance between the professional managers and the shareholders was all financed by squeezing the other stakeholders in the company (which is why it has spread much more slowly to other rich countries where the other stakeholders have greater relative strength). Jobs were ruthlessly cut, many workers were fired and re-hired as non-unionized labour with lower wages and fewer benefits, and wage increases were suppressed (often by relocating to or outsourcing from low-wage countries, such as China and India – or the threat to do so). The suppliers, and their workers, were also squeezed by continued cuts in procurement prices, while the government was pressured into lowering corporate tax rates and/or providing more subsidies, with the help of the threat of relocating to countries with lower corporate tax rates and/or higher business subsidies. As a result, income inequality soared (see Thing 13) and in a seemingly endless corporate boom (ending, of course, in 2008), the vast majority of the American and the British populations could share in the (apparent) prosperity only through borrowing at unprecedented rates.

The easiest way for a company to maximize profit is to reduce expenditure, as increasing revenues is more difficult – by cutting the wage bill through job cuts and by reducing capital expenditure by minimizing investment. Generating higher profit, however, is only the beginning of shareholder value maximization. The maximum proportion of the profit thus generated needs to be given to the shareholders in the form of higher dividends. Or the company uses part of the profits to buy back its own shares, thereby keeping the share prices up and thus indirectly redistributing even more profits to the shareholders (who can realize higher capital gains should they decide to sell some of their shares).

Unfortunately, despite being the legal owners of the company, shareholders are the ones who are least committed among the various stakeholders to the long-term viability of the company. This is because they are the ones who can exit the company most easily – they just need to sell their shares, if necessary at a slight loss, as long as they are smart enough not to stick to a lost cause for too long. In contrast, it is more difficult for other stakeholders, such as workers and suppliers, to exit the company and find another engagement, because they are likely to have accumulated skills and capital equipment (in the case of the suppliers) that are specific to the companies they do business with. Therefore, they have a greater stake in the long-run viability of the company than most shareholders. This is why maximizing shareholder value is bad for the company, as well as the rest of the economy.

Being heavily influenced, if not totally controlled, by longer-term stakeholders, companies in these countries do not as easily sack workers, squeeze suppliers, neglect investment and use profits for dividends and share buybacks as American and British companies do. All this means that in the long run they may be more viable than the American or the British companies. Just think about the way in which General Motors has squandered its absolute dominance of the world car industry and finally gone bankrupt while being on the forefront of shareholder value maximization by constantly downsizing and refraining from investment

The main reason that Sven is paid fifty times more than Ram is, to put it bluntly, protectionism – Swedish workers are protected from competition from the workers of India and other poor countries through immigration control. When you think about it, there is no reason why all Swedish bus drivers, or for that matter the bulk of the workforce in Sweden (and that of any other rich country), could not be replaced by some Indians, Chinese or Ghanaians. Most of these foreigners would be happy with a fraction of the wage rates that Swedish workers get paid, while all of them would be able to perform the job at least equally well, or even better. And we are not simply talking about low-skill workers such as cleaners or street-sweepers. There are huge numbers of engineers, bankers and computer programmers waiting out there in Shanghai, Nairobi or Quito, who can easily replace their counterparts in Stockholm, Linköping and Malmö. However, these workers cannot enter the Swedish labour market because they cannot freely migrate to Sweden due to immigration control. As a result, Swedish workers can command fifty times the wages of Indian workers, despite the fact that many of them do not have productivity rates that are higher than those of Indian workers.

In other words, poor people from poor countries are usually able to hold their own against their counterparts in rich countries. It is the rich from the poor countries who cannot do that. It is their low relative productivity that makes their countries poor, so their usual diatribe that their countries are poor because of all those poor people is totally misplaced. Instead of blaming their own poor people for dragging the country down, the rich of the poor countries should ask themselves why they cannot pull the rest of their countries up as much as the rich of the rich countries do.

If you stick me down in the middle of Bangladesh or Peru or someplace, you’ll find out how much this talent is going to produce in the wrong kind of soil. I will be struggling thirty years later.

What an individual is paid is not fully a reflection of her worth. Most people, in poor and rich countries, get paid what they do only because there is immigration control. Even those citizens of rich countries who cannot be easily replaced by immigrants, and thus may be said to be really being paid their worth (although they may not – see Thing 14), are as productive as they are only because of the socio-economic system they are operating in. It is not simply because of their individual brilliance and hard work that they are as productive as they are.

The main reason why there are so much fewer (of course, in proportional terms) domestic servants in the rich countries – although obviously not the only reason, given the cultural differences among countries at similar levels of income, today and in the past – is the higher relative price of labour. With economic development, people (or rather the labour services they offer) become more expensive in relative terms than ‘things’ (see also Thing 9). As a result, in rich countries, domestic service has become a luxury good that only the rich can afford, whereas it is still cheap enough to be consumed even by lower-middle-class people in developing countries.

In fact, the world was a lot more globalized a century ago than it was between the 1960s and the 1980s despite having much inferior technologies of communication and transportation, because in the latter period governments, especially the powerful governments, believed in tougher regulations of these cross-border flows.

More importantly, they added, even if it were true that the East Asian miracle owed something to government intervention, that does not mean that policies used by the East Asian countries can be recommended to other countries. Government officials who make policies are (like all of us) self-seeking agents, it was pointed out, more interested in expanding their own power and prestige rather than promoting national interests. They argued that government intervention worked in East Asia only because they had exceptionally selfless and capable bureaucrats for historical reasons (which we need not go into here). Even some of the economists who were supporting an active role for government conceded this point.

the gentleman chided the economists for misunderstanding the nature of modern bureaucracy, be it in the government or in the private sector. The Kobe Steel manager said (I am, of course, paraphrasing him): ‘I am sorry to say this, but you economists don’t understand how the real world works. I have a PhD in metallurgy and have been working in Kobe Steel for nearly three decades, so I know a thing or two about steel-making. However, my company is now so large and complex that even I do not understand more than half the things that are going on within it. As for the other managers – with backgrounds in accounting and marketing – they really haven’t much of a clue. Despite this, our board of directors routinely approves the majority of projects submitted by our employees, because we believe that our employees work for the good of the company. If we assumed that everyone is out to promote his own interests and questioned the motivations of our employees all the time, the company would grind to a halt, as we would spend all our time going through proposals that we really don’t understand. You simply cannot run a large bureaucratic organization, be it Kobe Steel or your government, if you assume that everyone is out for himself.’ This is merely an anecdote, but it is a powerful testimony to the limitations of standard economic theory, which assumes that self-interest is the only human motivation that counts. Let me elaborate.

Free-market economics starts from the assumption that all economic agents are selfish, as summed up in Adam Smith’s assessment of the butcher, the brewer and the baker. The beauty of the market system, they contend, is that it channels what seems to be the worst aspect of human nature – self-seeking, or greed, if you like – into something productive and socially beneficial.

Therefore, free-market economists recommend, the portion of the economy controlled by politicians and bureaucrats should be minimized.

This is all true. However, we also have a lot of evidence – not just anecdotes but systematic evidence – showing that self-interest is not the only human motivation that matters even in our economic life. Self-interest, to be sure, is one of the most important, but we have many other motives – honesty, self-respect, altruism, love, sympathy, faith, sense of duty, solidarity, loyalty, public-spiritedness, patriotism, and so on – that are sometimes even more important than self-seeking as the driver of our behaviours.

Do they say that you have to suspect people and watch them all the time for slacking and cheating? No, they probably talk mostly about how to ‘connect’ with the employees, change the way they see things, inspire them, and promote teamwork among them. Good managers know that people are not tunnel-visioned self-seeking robots. They know that people have ‘good’ sides and ‘bad’ sides and that the secret of good management is in magnifying the former and toning down the latter.

Not realizing the complex nature of worker motivation, the capitalists of the early mass-production era thought that, by totally depriving workers of discretion over the speed and the intensity of their work and thus their ability to shirk, the conveyor belt would maximize their productivity. However, as those capitalists soon found out, the workers reacted by becoming passive, un-thinking and even uncooperative, when they were deprived of their autonomy and dignity.

The pinnacle of such an approach is the so-called ‘Japanese production system’ (sometimes known as the ‘Toyota production system’), which exploits the goodwill and creativity of the workers by giving them responsibilities and trusting them as moral agents. In the Japanese system, workers are given a considerable degree of control over the production line. They are also encouraged to make suggestions for improving the production process. This approach has enabled Japanese firms to achieve such production efficiency and quality that now many non-Japanese companies are imitating them. By not assuming the worst about their workers, the Japanese companies have got the best out of them.

If people look as if they are behaving morally, they argue, it is only because the observers do not see the hidden rewards and sanctions that they are responding to. According to this line of reasoning, people always remain self-seekers. If they behave morally, it is not because they believe in the moral code itself but because behaving in that way maximizes rewards and minimizes punishments for them personally. For example, if traders refrain from cheating even when there is no legal compulsion or when there are no competitors ready to take away their businesses, it does not mean that they believe in honesty. It is because they know that having a reputation as an honest trader brings in more customers. Or many tourists who behave badly would not do the same at home, not because they suddenly become decent people when they go back home but because they do not have the anonymity of a tourist and therefore are afraid of being criticized or shunned by people they know and care about. There is some truth in this. There are subtle rewards and sanctions that are not immediately visible and people do respond to them. However, this line of reasoning does not work in the end. The fact is that, even when there are no hidden reward-and-sanction mechanisms at work, many of us behave honestly. For example, why do we – or at least those of us who are good runners – not run away without paying after a taxi ride?

The problem is that rewarding and punishing others for their behaviours costs time and energy only to the individuals taking the action, while their benefits from improved behavioural standards accrue to everyone. Going back to our examples above, if you, as a taxi driver, want to chase and beat up a runaway customer, you may have to risk getting fined for illegal parking or even having your taxi broken into. But what is the chance of you benefiting from an improved standard of behaviour by that passenger, who you may not meet ever again?

So, as a self-seeking individual, you wait for someone foolish enough to spend his time and energy in administering private justice to wayward taxi passengers or honest out-of-the-way garages, rather than paying the costs yourself. However, if everyone were a self-interested individual like you, everyone would do as you do. As a result, no one would reward and punish others for their good or bad behaviour. In other words, those invisible reward/sanction mechanisms that free-market economists say create the optical illusion of morality can exist only because we are not the selfish, amoral agents that those economists say we are.

Morality is not an optical illusion.

Invisible rewards and sanctions mechanisms do matter, but they cannot explain all – or, in my view, even the majority of – non-selfish behaviours,

Contrary to Mrs Thatcher’s assertion that ‘there is no such thing as society.

More importantly, if we design our economic system based on such an assumption, the result is likely to be lower, rather than higher, efficiency. If we did that, people would feel that they are not trusted as moral agents and refuse to act in moral ways, making it necessary for us to spend a huge amount of resources monitoring, judging and punishing people. If we assume the worst about people, we will get the worst out of them.

Even after the birth of the European single currency, the euro, and the consequent de facto abolition of national central banks in the Eurozone countries, Germany’s influence has made the European Central Bank (ECB) stick to tight monetary policy even in the face of persistently high unemployment, until the 2008 world financial crisis forced it to join other central banks around the world in an unprecedented relaxation of monetary policy. Thus, when talking about the consequences of

The experiences of individual countries also suggest that fairly high inflation is compatible with rapid economic growth. During the 1960s and 70s, Brazil had an average inflation rate of 42 per cent but was one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with its per capita income growing at 4.5 per cent a year. During the same period, per capita income in South Korea was growing at 7 per cent per year, despite having an annual average rate of inflation of nearly 20 per cent, which was actually higher than that found in many Latin American countries at the time.[19]

Moreover, there is evidence that excessive anti-inflationary policies can actually be harmful for the economy. Since 1996, when Brazil – having gone through a traumatic phase of rapid inflation, although not quite of hyperinflationary magnitude – started to control inflation by raising real interest rates (nominal interest rates minus the rate of inflation) to some of the highest levels in the world (10–12 per cent per year), its inflation fell to 7.1 per cent per year but its economic growth also suffered, with a per capita income growth rate of only 1.3 per cent per year.

Another sense in which the world has become more unstable during the last three decades is that job insecurity has increased for many people during this period. Job security has always been low in developing countries, but the share of insecure jobs in the so-called ‘informal sector’ – the collection of unregistered firms which do not pay taxes or observe laws, including those providing job security – has increased in many developing countries during the period, due to premature trade liberalization that destroyed a lot of secure ‘formal’ jobs in their industries.

In the study cited above, Rogoff and Reinhart point out that the share of countries in banking crises is very closely related to the degree of international capital mobility. This increased international mobility is a key goal for free-market economists, who believe that a greater freedom of capital to move across borders would improve the efficiency of the use of capital (see Thing 22). Consequently, they have pushed for capital market opening across the world, although recently they have been softening their position in this regard in relation to developing countries.

The free-market policy package, often known as the neo-liberal policy package, emphasizes lower inflation, greater capital mobility and greater job insecurity (euphemistically called greater labour market flexibility), essentially because it is mainly geared towards the interests of the holders of financial assets. Inflation control is emphasized because many financial assets have nominally fixed rates of return, so inflation reduces their real returns. Greater capital mobility is promoted because the main source of the ability for the holders of financial assets to reap higher returns than the holders of other (physical and human) assets is their ability to move around their assets more quickly (see Thing 22). Greater labour market flexibility is demanded because, from the point of view of financial investors, making hiring and firing of the workers easier allows companies to be restructured more quickly, which means that they can be sold and bought more readily with better short-term balance sheets, bringing higher financial returns (see Thing 2).

Hamilton is there because, unbeknown to most Americans today, he is the architect of the modern American economic system. Two years after becoming Treasury Secretary in 1789 at the outrageously young age of thirty-three, Hamilton submitted to the Congress the Report on the Subject of Manufactures, where he set out the economic development strategy for his young country. In the report, he argued that ‘industries in their infancy’, like the American ones, need to be protected and nurtured by government before they can stand on their own feet. Hamilton’s report was not just about trade protectionism – he also argued for public investment in infrastructure (such as canals), development of the banking system, promotion of a government bond market – but protectionism was at the heart of his strategy. Given his views, were Hamilton finance minister of a developing country today, he would have been heavily criticized by the US Treasury Department for his heresy. His country might even have been refused a loan from the IMF and the World Bank.

On the $50 bill, we have Ulysses Grant, the Civil War hero-turned president. In defiance of the British pressure on the USA to adopt free trade, he once remarked that ‘within 200 years, when America has gotten out of protection all that it can offer, it too will adopt free trade’.

At the time, the existence of almost-free land in the US made it necessary for American manufacturers to offer wages around four times higher than the European average, as otherwise the workers would have run away to set up farms (this was no idle threat, given that many of them were farmers in their previous lives) (see Thing 10). Therefore, Franklin argued, the American manufacturers could not survive unless they were protected from low-wage competition – or what is known as ‘social dumping’ today – from Europe. This is exactly the logic that Ross Perot, the billionaire-turned-politician, used in order to oppose the NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) in the 1992 presidential election campaign – a logic that 18.9 per cent of the American voters were happy to endorse.

Thomas Jefferson may have been against Hamilton’s protectionism but, unlike Hamilton, who supported the patent system, he argued strongly against patents. Jefferson believed that ideas are ‘like air’ and therefore should not be owned by anyone. Given the emphasis that most of today’s free-market economists put on the protection of patents and other intellectual property rights, his views would have gone down like a lead balloon among them.

Andrew Jackson, that protector of the ‘common man’ and fiscal conservative (he paid off all federal government debts for the first time in US history)? Unfortunately for his fans, even he would not pass the test. Under Jackson, average industrial tariffs were in the region of 35–40 per cent. He was also notoriously anti-foreign. When in 1836 he cancelled the licence for the semi-public (second) Bank of the USA (it was 20 per cent owned by the US federal government), one of the main excuses was that it was ‘too much’ owned by foreign (mainly British) investors. And how much was too much? Only 30 per cent. If some developing country president today cancelled the licence for a bank because it was 30 per cent owned by the Americans, it would send the US Treasury into a fit.

Britain adopted free trade only in the 1860s, when its industrial dominance was absolute. In the same way in which the US was the most protectionist country in the world during most of its phase of ascendancy (from the 1830s to the 1940s), Britain was one of the world’s most protectionist countries during much of its own economic rise (from the 1720s to the 1850s).

There were exceptions of course. The Netherlands, Switzerland (until the First World War) and Hong Kong used little protectionism, but even these countries did not follow today’s orthodox doctrines. Arguing that patents are artificial monopolies that go against the principle of free trade (a point which is strangely lost on most of today’s free-trade economists), the Netherlands and Switzerland refused to protect patents until the early twentieth century. Even though it did not do it on such principled grounds, Hong Kong was until recently even more notorious for its violation of intellectual property rights than the former countries.

The truth is that developing countries did not do badly at all during the ‘bad old days’ of protectionism and state intervention in the 1960s and 70s. In fact, their economic growth performance during the period was far superior to that achieved since the 1980s under greater opening and deregulation. Since the 1980s, in addition to rising inequality (which was to be expected from the pro-rich nature of the reforms – see Thing 13), most developing countries have experienced a significant deceleration in economic growth. Per capita income growth in the developing world fell from 3 per cent per year in the 1960s and 70s to 1.7 per cent during the 1980–2000 period, when there was the greatest number of free-market reforms. During the 2000s, there was a pick-up in the growth of the developing world, bringing the growth rate up to 2.6 per cent for the 1980–2009 period, but this was largely due to the rapid growth of China and India – two giants that, while liberalizing, did not embrace neo-liberal policies.

To sum up, the free-trade, free-market policies are policies that have rarely, if ever, worked. Most of the rich countries did not use such policies when they were developing countries themselves, while these policies have slowed down growth and increased income inequality in the developing countries in the last three decades. Few countries have become rich through free-trade, free-market policies and few ever will.

The upshot is that a company has no national loyalty any more. A business will do what it has to do in order to increase its profit, even if it means hurting its home country by shutting plants down, slashing jobs, or even bringing in foreign workers. Given this, many people argue, it is unwise to put restrictions on foreign ownership of companies, as many governments used to. As long as the company generates wealth and jobs within its borders, the country should not care whether the company is owned by its citizens or foreigners. When all major companies are ready to move anywhere in search of profit opportunities, making investment by foreign companies difficult means that your country is not going to benefit from those foreign companies that have identified good investment prospects in your country. It all makes sense, doesn’t it?

In most companies, however transnational their operations may seem, the top decision-makers still remain the citizens of the home country – that is, the country where ownership resides – despite the fact that long-distance management (when the acquiring company does not dispatch top managers to the acquired firm) can reduce management efficiency, while dispatching top managers to a foreign country is expensive, especially when the physical and the cultural distances between the two countries are great.

In short, few corporations are truly transnational. The vast majority of them still produce the bulk of their outputs in their home countries. Especially in terms of high-grade activities such as strategic decision-making and higher-end R&D, they remain firmly centred at their home countries.

If you put restrictions on what foreign investors can do – for example, by telling them that they cannot invest in certain ‘strategic’ industries, by forbidding them from holding a majority share or demanding that they transfer technologies – foreign investors will simply go somewhere else and you will lose the jobs and the wealth that they would have created. Especially for developing countries, which do not have many national firms that can make similar investments, rejecting foreign investment because it is foreign many people believe is frankly irrational. Even if they get only lower-grade activities such as assembly operation, they are still better off with the investment than without it.

However, the question that policy-makers need to consider before accepting it is how it is going to affect the future trajectory of their national economy. Different activities have different potentials for technological innovation and productivity growth, and therefore what you do today influences what you will be doing in the future and what you will get out of it. As a popular saying among American industrial policy experts in the 1980s went, we cannot pretend that it does not matter whether you produce potato chips, wood chips or microchips. And the chance is that a foreign company is more likely to produce potato chips or wood chips than microchips in your country.

In recent years, private equity funds have played an increasingly important role in corporate acquisitions. Even though they have no in-house expertise in particular industries, they may, in theory, acquire a company for the long term and hire industry experts as managers and ask them to upgrade its capabilities. However, in practice, these funds usually have no intention to upgrade the acquired company for the long term. They acquire firms with a view to selling them on in three to five years after restructuring them into profitability. Such restructuring, given the time horizon, usually involves cutting costs (especially sacking workers and refraining from long-term investments), rather than raising capabilities.

We may be living in a post-industrial society in the sense that most of us work in shops and offices rather than in factories. But we have not entered a post-industrial stage of development in the sense that industry has become unimportant. Most (although not all) of the shrinkage in the share of manufacturing in total output is not due to the fall in the absolute quantity of manufactured goods produced but due to the fall in their prices relative to those for services, which is caused by their faster growth in productivity (output per unit of input).

This is widely believed to be because, as they become richer, people begin to demand more services than manufactured goods. With falling demand, it is natural that the manufacturing sector shrinks and the country enters the post-industrial stage. Many people actually celebrate the rise of services. According to them, the recent expansion of knowledge-based services with rapid productivity growth – such as finance, consulting, design, computing and information services, R&D – means that services have replaced manufacturing as the engine of growth, at least in the rich countries. Manufacturing is now a low-grade activity that developing countries such as China perform.

Many people think that the remaining 80 per cent or so can be largely explained by the natural tendency of the (relative) demand for manufactured goods to fall with rising prosperity. However, a closer look reveals that this demand effect is actually very small. It looks as if we are spending ever higher shares of our income on services not because we are consuming ever more services in absolute terms but mainly because services are becoming ever more expensive in relative terms. With the (inflation-adjusted) amount of money you paid to get a PC ten years ago, today you can probably buy three, if not four, computers of equal or even greater computing power (and certainly smaller size). As a result, you probably have two, rather than just one, computers. But, even with two computers, the portion of your income that you spend on computers has gone down quite a lot (for the sake of argument, I am assuming that your income, after adjusting for inflation, is the same). In contrast, you are probably getting the same number of haircuts as you did ten years ago (if you haven’t gone thin on top, that is). The price of haircuts has probably gone up somewhat, so the proportion of your income that goes to your haircuts is greater than it was ten years ago. The result is that it looks as if you are spending a greater (smaller) portion of your income on haircuts (computers) than before, but the reality is that you are actually consuming more computers than before, while your consumption of haircuts is the same.

Then why are the relative prices of manufactured goods falling? It is because manufacturing industries tend to have faster productivity growth than services. As the output of the manufacturing sector increases faster than the output of the service sector, the prices of the manufactured goods relative to those of services fall. In manufacturing, where mechanization and the use of chemical processes are much easier, it is easier to raise productivity than in services. In contrast, by their very nature, many service activities are inherently impervious to productivity increase without diluting the quality of the product.

To sum up, the fall in the share of manufacturing in total output in the rich countries is not largely due to the fall in (relative) demand for manufactured goods, as many people think. Nor is it due mainly to the rise of manufactured exports from China and other developing countries, although that has had big impacts on some sectors. It is instead the falling relative prices of the manufactured goods due to faster growth in productivity in the manufacturing sector that is the main driver of the de-industrialization process. Thus, while the citizens of the rich countries may be living in post-industrial societies in terms of their employment, the importance of manufacturing in terms of production in those economies has not been diminished to the extent that we can declare a post-industrial age.

Unless the exports of manufactured goods rise disproportionately, the country won’t be able to pay for the same amount of imports as before. If its de-industrialization is of a negative kind accompanied by weakening international competitiveness, the balance of payments problem could be even more serious, as the manufacturing sector then won’t be able to increase its exports.

As for the developing countries, it is a fantasy to think that they can skip industrialization and build prosperity on the basis of service industries. Most services have slow productivity growth and most of those services that have high productivity growth are services that cannot be developed without a strong manufacturing sector. Low tradability of services means that a developing country specializing in services will face a bigger balance of payments problem, which for a developing country means a reduction in its ability to upgrade its economy. Post-industrial fantasies are bad enough for the rich countries, but they are positively dangerous for developing countries.

the same dollar buys more things in the US than in most other rich countries mainly because it has cheaper services than in other comparable countries, thanks to higher immigration and poorer employment conditions. Furthermore, Americans work considerably longer than Europeans. Per hour worked, their command over goods and services is smaller than that of several European countries. While we can debate which is a better lifestyle – more material goods with less leisure time (as in the US) or fewer material goods with more leisure time (as in Europe) – this suggests that the US does not have an unambiguously higher living standard than comparable countries.

In the early nineteenth century, US per capita income was still only around the European average and something like 50 per cent lower than that of Britain and the Netherlands. But poor Europeans still wanted to move there because the country had an almost unlimited supply of land (well, if you were willing to push out a few native Americans) and an acute labour shortage, which meant wages three or four times higher than those in Europe (see Thing 7). Most importantly, the lack of feudal legacy meant that the country had much higher social mobility than the Old World countries, as celebrated in the idea of the American dream.

Second, the very fact that its PPP income is more or less the same as its market exchange rate income is proof that the higher average living standard in the US is built on the poverty of many. What do I mean by this? As I have pointed out earlier, it is normal for a rich country’s PPP income to be lower, sometimes significantly, than its market exchange rate income, because it has expensive service workers. However, this does not happen to the US, because, unlike other rich countries, it has cheap service workers. To begin with, there is a large inflow of low-wage immigrants from poor countries, many of them illegal, which makes them even cheaper. Moreover, even the native workers have much weaker fallback positions in the US than in European countries of comparable income level. Because they have much less job security and weaker welfare supports, US workers, especially the non-unionized ones in the service industries, work for lower wages and under inferior conditions than do their European counterparts. This is why things like taxi rides and meals at restaurants are so much cheaper in the US than in other rich countries. This is great when you are the customer, but not if you are the taxi driver or the waitress. In other words, the higher purchasing power of average US income is bought at the price of lower income and inferior working conditions for many US citizens.

There is no simple way to compare living standards across countries. Per capita income, especially in purchasing power terms, is arguably the most reliable indicator. However, by focusing just on how many goods and services our income can buy, we miss out a lot of other things that constitute elements of the ‘good life’, such as the amount of quality leisure time, job security, freedom from crime, access to healthcare, social welfare provisions, and so on. While different individuals and countries will definitely have different views on how to weigh these indicators against each other and against income figures, non-income dimensions should not be ignored, if we are to build societies where people genuinely ‘live well’.

Moreover, all the structural handicaps that are supposed to hold back Africa have been present in most of today’s rich countries – poor climate (arctic and tropical), landlockedness, abundant natural resources, ethnic divisions, poor institutions and bad culture. These structural conditions seem to act as impediments to development in Africa only because its countries do not yet have the necessary technologies, institutions and organizational skills to deal with their adverse consequences.

During the 1960s and 70s, per capita income in Sub-Saharan Africa grew at a respectable rate. At around 1.6 per cent, it was nowhere near the ‘miracle’ growth rate of East Asia (5–6 per cent) or even that of Latin America (around 3 per cent) during the period. However, this is not a growth rate to be sniffed at. It compares favourably with the rates of 1–1.5 per cent achieved by today’s rich countries during their Industrial ‘Revolution’ (roughly 1820–1913).

Since the late 1970s (starting with Senegal in 1979), Sub-Saharan African countries were forced to adopt free-market, free-trade policies through the conditions imposed by the so-called Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) of the World Bank and the IMF (and the rich countries that ultimately control them). Contrary to conventional wisdom, these policies are not good for economic development (see Thing 7). By suddenly exposing immature producers to international competition, these policies led to the collapse of what little industrial sectors these countries had managed to build up during the 1960s and 70s. Thus, having been forced back into relying on exports of primary commodities, such as cocoa, coffee and copper, African countries have continued to suffer from the wild price fluctuations and stagnant production technologies that characterize most such commodities.

So, the so-called structural factors are really scapegoats wheeled out by free-market economists. Seeing their favoured policies failing to produce good outcomes, they had to find other explanations for Africa’s stagnation (or retrogression, if you don’t count the last few years of growth spike due to commodity boom, which has come to an end). It was unthinkable for them that such ‘correct’ policies could fail. It is no coincidence that structural factors came to be cited as the main explanations of poor African economic performance only after growth evaporated in the early 1980s.

Natural resources allow poor countries to earn the foreign exchanges with which they can buy advanced technologies. Saying that those resources are a curse is like saying that all children born into a rich family will fail in life because they will get spoilt by their inherited wealth. Some do so exactly for this reason, but there are many others who take advantage of their inheritance and become even more successful than their parents. The fact that a factor is structural (that is, it is given by nature or history) does not mean that the outcome of its influence is predetermined.

Let us first take the case of the climate. Tropical climate is supposed to cripple economic growth by creating health burdens due to tropical diseases, especially malaria. This is a terrible problem, but surmountable. Many of today’s rich countries used to have malaria and other tropical diseases, at least during the summer – not just Singapore, which is bang in the middle of the tropics, but also Southern Italy, the Southern US, South Korea and Japan. These diseases do not matter very much any more only because these countries have better sanitation (which has vastly reduced their incidence) and better medical facilities, thanks to economic development.

People say that bad institutions are holding back Africa (and they are), but when the rich countries were at similar levels of material development to those we find in Africa currently, their institutions were in a far worse state.[35] Despite that, they grew continuously and have reached high levels of development. They built the good institutions largely after, or at least in tandem with, their economic development. This shows that institutional quality is as much an outcome as the causal factor of economic development.

Moreover, despite having these impediments (often in more severe forms), African countries themselves did not have a problem growing in the 1960s and 70s. The main reason for Africa’s recent growth failure lies in policy – namely, the free-trade, free-market policy that has been imposed on the continent through the SAP. Nature and history do not condemn a country to a particular future. If it is policy that is causing the problem, the future can be changed even more easily. The fact that we have failed to see this, and not its allegedly chronic growth failure, is the real tragedy of Africa.

Even in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when government industrial policies were much less organized and effective than in the late twentieth century, virtually all of today’s rich countries used tariffs, subsidies, licensing, regulation and other policy measures to promote particular industries over others, with considerable degrees of success (see Thing 7).

Yet another method is to rely on informal networks between government officials and business elites so that the officials develop a good understanding of business situations, although an exclusive reliance on this channel can lead to excessive ‘clubbiness’ or downright corruption. The French policy network, built around the graduates of ENA (École Nationale d’Administration), is the most famous example of this, showing both its positive and negative sides. Somewhere in between the two extremes of legal requirement and personal networks, the Japanese have developed the ‘deliberation councils’, where government officials and business leaders regularly exchange information through formal channels, in the presence of third-party observers from academia and the media.

However, it is more than that. Government attempts to pick winners have failed even in countries that are famous for being good at it, such as Japan, France or Korea. I’ve already mentioned the French government’s ill-fated foray into Concorde. In the 1960s, the Japanese government tried in vain to arrange a takeover of Honda, which it considered to be too small and weak, by Nissan, but it later turned out that Honda was a much more successful firm than Nissan. The Korean government tried to promote the aluminium-smelting industry in the late 1970s, only to see the industry whacked by a massive increase in energy prices, which account for a particularly high proportion of aluminium production costs. And they are just the most prominent examples.

The reality is that winners are being picked all the time both by the government and by the private sector, but the most successful ones tend to be done in joint efforts between the two. In all types of winner-picking – private, public, joint – there are successes and failures, sometimes spectacular ones. If we remain blinded by the free-market ideology that tells us only winner-picking by the private sector can succeed, we will end up ignoring a huge range of possibilities for economic development through public leadership or public–private joint efforts.

It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.

Unlike today’s liberal economists, the Classical economists did not see the capitalist economy as being made up of individuals. They believed that people belonged to different classes – capitalists, workers and landlords – and behaved differently according to their classes. The most important inter-class behavioural difference was considered to be the fact that capitalists invested (virtually) all of their incomes while the other classes – the working class and the landlord class – consumed them.

This is where ardent free-marketeers like Ricardo meet ultra-left wing communists like Preobrazhensky. Despite their apparent differences, both of them believed that the investible surplus should be concentrated in the hands of the investor, the capitalist class in the case of the former and the planning authority in the case of the latter, in order to maximize economic growth in the long run. This is ultimately what people today have in mind when they say that ‘you first have to create wealth before you can redistribute it’.

Of course, trickle down is not a completely stupid idea. We cannot judge the impact of income redistribution only by its immediate effects, however good or bad they may look. When rich people have more money, they may use it to increase investment and growth, in which case the long-run effect of upward income redistribution may be the growth in the absolute size, although not necessarily the relative share, of income that everyone gets.

in countries with a strong welfare state it is a lot easier to spread the benefits of extra growth that follows upward income redistribution (if it happens) through taxes and transfers. Indeed, before taxes and transfers, income distribution is actually more unequal in Belgium and Germany than in the US, while in Sweden and the Netherlands it is more or less the same as in the US.[40] In other words, we need the electric pump of the welfare state to make the water at the top trickle

Thus seen, there is no reason to presume that upward income redistribution will accelerate investment and growth. This has not happened in general. Even when there is more growth, the trickle down that occurs through the market mechanism is very limited, as seen in the above comparison of the US with other rich countries with a good welfare state. Simply making the rich richer does not make the rest of us richer. If giving more to the rich is going to benefit the rest of the society, the rich have to be made to deliver higher investment and thus higher growth through policy measures (e.g., tax cuts for the rich individuals and corporations, conditional on investment), and then share the fruits of such growth through a mechanism such as the welfare state.

In other words, worker pay in the US has been virtually stagnant since the mid 1970s. Of course, this is not to say that Americans have not seen any rise in living standards since the 1970s. Family income, as opposed to individual worker compensation, has risen, but that is only because more and more families have both partners working.

Thus seen, US managers are over-priced. The American workers get paid only 15 per cent or so more than their counterparts in competitor nations, while the American CEOs are paid at least twice (compared to the Swiss managers, excluding stock options) and possibly up to twenty times (compared to the Japanese managers, including stock options) that of what their counterparts in comparable countries are paid. Despite this, the American CEOs are running companies that are no better, and frequently worse, than their Japanese or European competitors.

This seems plausible. The competitive process works to eliminate inefficient practices, be they obsolete textile technologies or biased executive pay schemes. And the fact that American and British companies have been losing to foreign companies, which on the whole have better managerial incentives, is a proof of it.

When the managerial classes in the US and, to a lesser extent Britain, possess such economic, political and ideological power that they can manipulate the market and pass on the negative consequences of their actions to other people, it is an illusion to think that executive pay is something whose optimal levels and structures are going to be, and should be, determined by the market.

The problem is that there is only a limited range of (simple) businesses that the poor in developing countries can take on, given their limited skills, the narrow range of technologies available, and the limited amount of finance that they can mobilize through microfinance. So, you, a Croatian farmer who bought one more milk cow with a microcredit, stick to selling milk even as you watch the bottom falling out of your local milk market thanks to the 300 other farmers like you selling more milk, because turning yourself into an exporter of butter to Germany or cheese to Britain simply isn’t possible with the technologies, the organizational skills and the capital you have.

If effective entrepreneurship ever was a purely individual thing, it has stopped being so at least for the last century. The collective ability to build and manage effective organizations and institutions is now far more important than the drives or even the talents of a nation’s individual members in determining its prosperity (see Thing 17). Unless we reject the myth of heroic individual entrepreneurs and help them build institutions and organizations of collective entrepreneurship, we will never see the poor countries grow out of poverty on a sustainable basis.

The world is very complex and our ability to deal with it is severely limited. Therefore, we need to, and usually do, deliberately restrict our freedom of choice in order to reduce the complexity of problems we have to face. Often, government regulation works, especially in complex areas like the modern financial market, not because the government has superior knowledge but because it restricts choices and thus the complexity of the problems at hand, thereby reducing the possibility that things may go wrong.

According to Simon, we try to be rational, but our ability to be so is severely limited. The world is too complex, Simon argued, for our limited intelligence to understand fully. This means that very often the main problem we face in making a good decision is not the lack of information but our limited capability to process that information – a point nicely illustrated by the fact that the celebrated advent of the internet age does not seem to have improved the quality of our decisions, judging by the mess we are in today.

A large part of this is due to the simple fact that mechanization is the most important way to increase productivity. But an influential Marxist school of thought argues that capitalists deliberately ‘de-skill’ their workers by using the most mechanized production technologies possible, even if they are not the most economical, in order to make the workers more easily replaceable and thus easier to control.[58] Whatever the exact cause of the mechanization process, the upshot is that more technologically developed economies may actually need fewer educated people.

The main explanation for the ‘Swiss paradox’ should be found, once again, in the low productivity content of education. However, in the case of higher education, the non-productivity component is not so much about teaching people subjects that will help them with things such as personal fulfilment, good citizenship and national identity, as in the case of primary and secondary education.

So, people go to university, fully knowing that they will ‘waste time’ studying things that they will never need for their work. With everyone wanting to go to university, the demand for higher education increases, which then leads to the supply of more university places, which raises university enrolment rate further, increasing the pressure to go to university even more. Over time, this leads to a process of degree inflation. Now that ‘everyone’ has a university degree, you have to do a master’s, or even a PhD, in order to stand out, even if the productivity content of those further degrees may be minimal for your future jobs.

this still means that at least half of university education in countries such as the US, Korea and Finland is ‘wasted’ in the essentially zero-sum game of sorting. The higher education system in these countries has become like a theatre in which some people decided to stand to get a better view, prompting others behind them to stand. Once enough people stand, everyone has to stand, which means that no one is getting a better view, while everyone has become more uncomfortable.

Education is valuable, but its main value is not in raising productivity. It lies in its ability to help us develop our potentials and live a more fulfilling and independent life. If we expanded education in the belief that it will make our economies richer, we will be sorely disappointed, for the link between education and national productivity is rather tenuous and complicated. Our overenthusiasm with education should be tamed, and, especially in developing countries, far greater attention needs to be paid to the issue of establishing and upgrading productive enterprises and institutions that support them.

The story of GM teaches us some salutary lessons about the potential conflicts between corporate and national interests – what is good for a company, however important it may be, may not be good for the country. Moreover, it highlights the conflicts between different stakeholders that make up the firm – what is good for some stakeholders of a company, such as managers and short-term shareholders, may not be good for others, such as workers and suppliers. Ultimately, it also tells us that what is good for a company in the short run may not even be good for it in the long run – what is good for GM today may not be good for GM tomorrow.

Sometimes regulations help business by limiting the ability of firms to engage in activities that bring them greater profits in the short run but ultimately destroy the common resource that all business firms need. For example, regulating the intensity of fish farming may reduce the profits of individual fish farms but help the fish-farming industry as a whole by preserving the quality of water that all the fish farms have to use.

But you don’t need to be a Marxist to see that regulations restricting freedom for individual firms may promote the collective interest of the entire business sector, not to speak of the nation as a whole. In other words, there are many regulations that are pro- rather than anti-business. Many regulations help preserve the common-pool resources that all firms share, while others help business by making firms do things that raise their collective productivity in the long run. Only when we recognize this will we be able to see that what matters is not the absolute amount of regulation, but the aims and contents of those regulations.

Many capitalist governments plan the future shape of individual industrial sectors through sectoral industrial policy or even that of the national economy through indicative planning. More importantly, modern capitalist economies are made up of large, hierarchical corporations that plan their activities in great detail, even across national borders. Therefore, the question is not whether you plan or not. It is about planning the right things at the right levels.

Given the political commitment to high equality, there was a clear cap on how much a business manager, however successful, could get. This meant that there was only a limited incentive for business managers to turn the advanced technologies that the system was clearly capable of producing into products that consumers actually wanted. The policy of full employment at all costs meant that managers could not use the ultimate threat – that of sacking – to discipline workers. This contributed to sloppy work and absenteeism; when he was trying to reform the Soviet economy, Gorbachev frequently spoke of the problem of labour discipline.

Under central planning, the economy will produce only exactly what is needed. No resource will lie idle at any time, since there will be no economic crisis. Therefore, the central planning system, it was argued, will manage the economy much more efficiently than the market system. That, at least, was the theory.

Unlike under central planning, these targets are not legally binding; hence the adjective ‘indicative’. However, the government will do its best to achieve them by mobilizing various carrots (e.g., subsidies, granting of monopoly rights) and sticks (e.g., regulations, influence through state-owned banks) at its disposal.

Businesses plan their activities – often down to the last detail. Indeed, that is where Marx got the idea of centrally planning the whole economy. When he talked about planning, there was in fact no real-life government that was practising planning. At the time, only firms planned. What Marx predicted was that the ‘rational’ planning approach of the capitalist firms would eventually prove superior to the wasteful anarchy of the market and thus eventually be extended to the whole economy. To be sure, he criticized planning within the firm as despotism by capitalists, but he believed that, once private property was abolished and the capitalists eliminated, the rational elements of such despotism could be isolated and harnessed for the social good.

It is what the appropriate levels and forms of planning are for different activities. The prejudice against planning, while understandable given the failures of communist central planning, makes us misunderstand the true nature of the modern economy in which government policy, corporate planning and market relationships are all vital and interact in a complex way. Without markets we will end up with the inefficiencies of the Soviet system. However, thinking that we can live by the market alone is like believing that we can live by eating only salt, because salt is vital for our survival.

When you reward people the same way regardless of their efforts and achievements, the more talented and the harder-working lose the incentive to perform. This is equality of outcome. It’s a bad idea, as proven by the fall of communism. The equality we seek should be the equality of opportunity.

Equality of opportunity is the starting point for a fair society. But it’s not enough. Of course, individuals should be rewarded for better performance, but the question is whether they are actually competing under the same conditions as their competitors. If a child does not perform well in school because he is hungry and cannot concentrate in class, it cannot be said that the child does not do well because he is inherently less capable.

Unless there is some equality of outcome (i.e., the incomes of all the parents are above a certain minimum threshold, allowing their children not to go hungry), equal opportunities (i.e., free schooling) are not truly meaningful.

This point is powerfully illustrated by the fact that even the notoriously racist apartheid regime in South Africa had to designate the Japanese ‘honorary whites’. There was no way the Japanese executives running the local Toyota and Nissan factories could go and live in townships like Soweto, where non-whites were forced to live under apartheid law. Therefore, the white-supremacist South Africans had to swallow their pride and pretend that the Japanese were whites, if they wanted to drive around in Japanese cars. That is the power of the market.

The point is that, in order to benefit from the equal opportunities provided to them, people require the capabilities to make use of them. It is no use that black South Africans now have the same opportunities as whites to get a highly paid job, if they do not have the education to qualify for those jobs. It is no good that blacks now can enter better (former white-only) universities, if they still have to attend poorly funded schools with underqualified teachers, some of whom can barely read and write themselves.

Of course, in an idealized free market, this should not be a problem because the American steelworkers and the British shipbuilders can get jobs in expanding industries.

Excessive equalization of outcomes is harmful, although what exactly is excessive is debatable. Nevertheless, equality of opportunity is not enough. Unless we create an environment where everyone is guaranteed some minimum capabilities through some guarantee of minimum income, education and healthcare, we cannot say that we have fair competition. When some people have to run a 100 metre race with sandbags on their legs, the fact that no one is allowed to have a head start does not make the race fair. Equality of opportunity is absolutely necessary but not sufficient in building a genuinely fair and efficient society.

The point of all the above examples is that, when people know they will have a second (or third or even fourth) chance, they will be much more open to risk-taking when it comes to choosing their first job (as in the Korean example) or letting go of their existing jobs (as in the US– Europe comparison).

In the same way that bankruptcy laws encourage risk-taking by entrepreneurs, the welfare state encourages workers to be more open to change (and the resulting risks) in their attitudes. Because they know that there is going to be a second chance, people can be bolder in their initial career choices and more open to changing jobs later in their careers.

If the outer shell is damaged, water vapour escapes as it is heated, and the pressure never builds up. The reason that popcorn pops and other grains don’t is that all the others have porous shells. If a kernel is too dry, perhaps because it was harvested at the wrong time, there isn’t enough water inside it to build up the pressure needed to burst the shell.

There are indeed lots of molecules and lots of collisions and lots of different speeds, but the only two important factors are the range of speeds that the molecules are moving at, and the average number of times they collide with the walls of their container. The number of collisions, and the strength of each collision (due to the speed and mass of that molecule) determine the pressure. The push made by all that compared with the push from the outside determines the volume. And then the temperature has a slightly different effect.

| Next | Section menu | Main menu | Previous | Leading teams: Tactics inspired by the Middle East By Randall S Peterson A snapshot of the Arab Middle East’s business culture has to take into consideration 17 countries with a combined population of 218 million. So it’s a valuable model for negotiating diverse cultural norms, wherever in the world you’re doing business. If you’re an entrepreneur setting up in, say, Saudi Arabia, you won’t get far without meeting people face-to-face and a little ‘wasta’. It’s important to invest time in building relationships. In Kuwait, family matters: business is preferably done with known and trusted people. Leaders are accessible, with a widely-adopted open-door approach in the Arab business world. If you’re visiting someone based in Bahrain and they are unexpectedly called away to consult on a pressing matter, be prepared to wait. In the UAE, 80% of the population are expatriates with large groups of Europeans, Asian Muslims, as well as people from around the Arab region. “The nature of the diverse and multicultural society there means that many western business leaders can run their organisations without fully understanding local customs and values,” says Randall S Peterson, Professor of Organisational Behaviour and Academic Director of the Leadership Institute at London Business School. “But it doesn’t mean they shouldn’t try. “Arab Middle Eastern culture is rooted in trust. People are generally guided by tenets of the Quran: they respect their culture, uphold their traditions and value relationships.” What’s more, he says the Arab Middle East leadership style can teach people worldwide lessons in teamwork. Leaders shaped by culture Culture and teamwork are inextricably linked. Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede summarised culture – the way we do things – as software of the mind. “Software” refers to a web of instructions that allow users to perform tasks, while “mind” is the part that makes people think, feel and experience. An African banker working in London differs from an Asian entrepreneur operating in Berlin and a German engineer leading a team in Hong Kong. Identities are shaped by factors including family, friends, nationalities, careers and location. Professor Peterson says Hofstede’s research shows that the Arab Middle East is high in “power distance”, where power between leaders and their team members is often distributed unequally, meaning once a leader has taken a decision the members are expected to implement faithfully. Leaders in high-power distance cultures have more power than their low-power distance counterparts, such as the US and UK where team members expect to help set the agenda and have direct influence on the final decision. In countries such as these, where freedom of speech is embedded in society, people offer their opinions freely, often making it difficult for leaders to coordinate. The Arab Middle East and China are both high-power distance cultures. Does that mean that two separate regions 5,724 km apart promote the same kind of leadership and teamwork? “It’s too simplistic to think that Arab and Chinese leaders operate in the same way,” says Professor Peterson. For instance, Chinese team members are unlikely to challenge their leaders. An opinion that makes you stand out in China’s collectivist culture may not work in your favour the way it does in the Arab Middle East. “Leading across cultures is more nuanced than that,” he says. And the full picture still requires some colouring in. Ongoing research by Professor Peterson into this cultural diversity challenge, including hundreds of interviews with business leaders around the globe, is gradually revealing a tapestry of leadership and teamwork traits. Some emerging themes from discussions with leaders in the Arab Middle East already offer lessons in teamwork – with each finding informing the next. Build trust on a foundation of excellence Trust is a universal imperative for good working relationships no matter where you work, so not unique to teams in the Arab Middle East. However, honour is also important, with a corresponding desire to avoid public shame. One leader in Qatar interviewed as part of Professor Peterson’s research reported: “Our religion and society tells us to complete our job in the best possible way.” Another reported that Islam promoted “sincerity and excellence”, which encouraged his team to produce high-quality work. Everyone has a purpose “A team is like a bee hive. Everyone in the hive knows their role, when to leave and enter, when to place the honey, when to protect the nest, and when to advise the leader,” another manager shared. One interviewee likened their team to a body: “If one part aches because of an ailment, the rest of the body feels the pain. If it weakens from one side, it is strengthened by the other.” This metaphor rings true throughout team dynamics in the Arab Middle East. Trust and clear goals embolden team members to challenge and advise their superiors at appropriate times. Many leaders reject the traditional notion that workers must “blindly” follow them. Because of their rituals and values, leaders are expected to consult with their teams. Open-door culture Arab leaders can generally be called on at any time and they often establish open and transparent relationships with employees by introducing open-door policies. But that doesn’t mean holding a team up to the light and expecting to see straight through them: conflict is inevitable. It’s human nature to disagree. If employees suppress their true opinions it “kills the work” declared one leader. Another reported encouraging healthy debate, saying: “My door is always open. I don’t see any harm in differences of opinion. Rather, good can come from it, especially if the one disagreeing has expertise in a particular field.” Balance consulting with decision-making It’s a religious and moral obligation for leaders in the Arab Middle East to consult their people before exercising power. “Consultation is in our Islamic heritage,” another leader reminds us. “Even the Prophet Muhammad consulted his companions, taking on their opinions.” Though management structures are typically more hierarchical in the Arab Middle East than in western European firms, decisions taken without consultation are viewed as illegitimate. With that being the case, how are decisions ever made? It seems like a complicated dance. “It’s more of an intricate ballet,” says Professor Peterson. After consultation with the team, leaders assert their power, making decisions grounded in merit. It’s not uncommon to hear managers say, ‘I reject an employee’s loyalty to me. Loyalty should be to the work alone’ or, ‘My work is for the sake of the organisation’. Choices are made irrespective of personal opinions; they are made for the good of the organisation. It seems managers in the Arab Middle East make choices based on excellence, so after taking on subordinate’s perspectives, their decision stands. “But of course, when you throw different cultures into the mix, the advice for leaders and their teams is different again,” says Professor Peterson. “That’s the cultural diversity challenge.” Randall S Peterson is a Professor of Organisational Behaviour, Chair, Organisational Behaviour Faculty at London Business School.

Crist rejected the notion that these “unconscionable” prices reflected a truly free exchange: This is not the normal free market situation where willing buyers freely elect to enter into the marketplace and meet willing sellers, where a price is agreed upon based on supply and demand. In an emergency, buyers under duress have no freedom. Their purchases of necessities like safe lodging are forced.9

So when we probe our reactions to price gouging, we find ourselves pulled in two directions: We are outraged when people get things they don’t deserve; greed that preys on human misery, we think, should be punished, not rewarded. And yet we worry when judgments about virtue find their way into law.

By contrast, modern political philosophers—from Immanuel Kant in the eighteenth century to John Rawls in the twentieth century—argue that the principles of justice that define our rights should not rest on any particular conception of virtue, or of the best way to live. Instead, a just society respects each person’s freedom to choose his or her own conception of the good life.

Once beyond school age, individuals were all expected to carry out two functions: to contribute to production and to take part in military operations. The whole system was based on the “Four Military Lines.” The key tenets were “arm the entire people,” “fortify the entire nation,” “build a nation of military leaders,” and “complete military modernization.” So various militias were formed.

North Koreans didn’t have anything to compare their country with because they’d never experienced anything else. Even when Kim Il-sung did something particularly brutal or horrific, no one raised an eyebrow. “Remember the time of Japanese colonial rule!” “Never forget the cruelty of American imperialism!” Without any other information at their disposal, young North Koreans simply fell for the propaganda.

I learned that after high school graduation in North Korea, there were three paths to choose from. Except there weren’t. In reality, your path was chosen for you. Basically, if you were clever and your birth and background were good enough, you were sent to university. If you were physically strong, you went to the military academy or became a common soldier. The rest were sent to workplaces as laborers. The most important factor in path determination was not how hard you worked but your assigned caste. The three castes were “nucleus” (or “core”), “basic” (or “wavering”), and “hostile.” Three criteria determined your caste: your birth and background, your perceived loyalty to the party, and your connections. Academic achievements had nothing to do with it, no matter how excellent they were. Your whole life was determined by which caste you’d been consigned to.

This was laughable, of course, but that’s always the way with totalitarian regimes. Language gets turned on its head. Serfdom is freedom. Repression is liberation. A police state is a democratic republic. And we were “the masters of our destiny.” And if we begged to differ, we were dead.

So the first biological lesson of history is that life is competition. Competition is not only the life of trade, it is the trade of life—peaceful when food abounds, violent when the mouths outrun the food. Animals eat one another without qualm; civilized men consume one another by due process of law. Co-operation is real, and increases with social development, but mostly because it is a tool and form of competition; we co-operate in our group—our family, community, club, church, party, “race,” or nation—in order to strengthen our group in its competition with other groups.

So why are the number ones in high school so rarely the number ones in real life? There are two reasons. First, schools reward students who consistently do what they are told. Academic grades correlate only loosely with intelligence (standardized tests are better at measuring IQ). Grades are, however, an excellent predictor of self-discipline, conscientiousness, and the ability to comply with rules.

there are actually two fundamentally different types of leaders. The first kind rises up through formal channels, getting promoted, playing by the rules, and meeting expectations. These leaders, like Neville Chamberlain, are “filtered.” The second kind doesn’t rise up through the ranks; they come in through the window: entrepreneurs who don’t wait for someone to promote them; U.S. vice presidents who are unexpectedly handed the presidency; leaders who benefit from a perfect storm of unlikely events, like the kind that got Abraham Lincoln elected. This group is “unfiltered.”

By the time filtered candidates are in the running for the top spot, they have been so thoroughly vetted that they can be relied upon to make the standard, traditionally approved decisions. They are effectively indistinguishable from one another—and this is why much of the research showed little effect for leaders.

Eighty percent of our evaluations of other people come down to two characteristics: warmth and competence. And a study from Teresa Amabile at Harvard called “Brilliant but Cruel” shows we assume the two are inversely related: if someone is too nice, we figure they must be less competent.

Research by Dan Ariely of Duke University shows that seeing others cheat and get away with it increases cheating across the board. We start to see cheating as an acceptable social norm. It’s a concept we can all relate to. After all, do you really drive under the speed limit all the time? Why not? Well, it’s like the old joke about ethics. There are three categories: “right,” “wrong,” and “everybody does it.” Once we see others getting away with something, we assume it’s okay.

Simply put, when you start being selfish and Machiavellian, others will eventually notice. If they retaliate before you rise to power, you’re in bad shape. Even if you succeed, you’ve still got a problem. You’ve shown others that the way to succeed is by breaking the rules, so they’ll break them too, because bad behavior is infectious and people do what works. You’ll be creating other predators like yourself. Then the good people leave. That creates a ripple effect: you can quickly create a place where you don’t want to work anymore, like Moldova. Once trust goes, everything goes.

TFT had a number of things going for it. By initially cooperating, it showed goodwill. With other “nice” programs, it quickly started cooperating and increasing value. With punishing programs, they effectively became nice programs. With programs like Tester, TFT showed a willingness to punch them in the nose if they betrayed. It was no wimp. So those programs got in line. TFT also displayed something vital: forgiveness. By not being complex, by only remembering what the other player did most recently, TFT was able to bring out the best in almost any program that was not totally evil or utterly random. TFT was not just a cooperator and a punisher but also a teacher. It showed the other players how to play better. Axelrod says that one of the reasons the not-nice programs performed so poorly is because they could not forgive and got caught in death spirals.

Pseudo-knowledge and pseudo-science operate and propagate by being unfalsifiable – as with astrology, we are unable to prove them either correct or incorrect because the conditions under which they would be shown false are never stated. 3.

In fact, you can use someone else’s money to do all of that. Money is not just about the bills in your wallet. Our whole financial system is built around a simple but powerful idea: credit. Banks, and the many institutions that function like banks, are intermediaries that match lenders and borrowers (taking a fee, of course, for the service). In that lending process, something remarkable happens: financial institutions create credit, which expands the supply of money.

So are deposits held in checking accounts or other accounts with check-writing privileges because you can use them to buy things now.

Currency technically comprises the paper notes and coins that circulate—the dollars in your wallet, the coins on your dresser, and so on. Money is a broader concept that includes currency but also other assets that can be used to make purchases or quickly converted to currency, such as checking account deposits. All currency is money, but not all money is currency. That said, a nation’s currency, such as the Japanese yen or the Chinese yuan, typically refers to all its money, not just the bills and coins.

Here is the irony: as long as the people using the rice certificates are confident they can redeem them at any time, most will feel no urgency to do so. But it’s also true that if there is even a whiff of doubt about the value of those rice certificates—whether it is justified or not—you are going to have a mob of certificate-wielding people banging on your door and demanding rice. This turns out to be a potentially destabilizing feature not just of commodity-based money but of the broader financial system. Even the most complex financial systems can thrive or fail depending on whether people believe they will thrive or fail.

The torn Indian rupees are real money, yet you can’t use them to buy a cup of tea. The Somali shillings—and certainly the counterfeit Somali shillings—were not real money, in the absence of a government to declare them legal tender, except that you could use them to buy a cup of tea. Here, the simple becomes the profound: If you can swap something easily and predictably for goods and services, it’s money. If you can’t, it’s not. There is even a continuum in between. Moneychangers across Africa offer better rates for new American bills than for older ones. A $100 bill signed by a current Treasury secretary gets a better rate than a $100 signed by John Snow (Bush administration) or Robert Rubin (Clinton administration). Clean, crisp bills get a better rate than old, dirty bills. And a single $100 bill is more valuable than five $20s.10

Fortunately, there is an easy fix for the uncertainty surrounding the supply of any single commodity: a currency backed by a basket of commodities. Suppose each “commodity dollar” could be exchanged for a kilo of rice, a gallon of gasoline, a quart of milk, six songs on iTunes, and so on. The accounting would become a little more difficult, but consumers would grow accustomed to the system as long as the value of the currency remained stable. The holders of these commodity dollars would be insulated against a sudden increase or decrease in the supply of any single commodity. The currency would have real, well-defined purchasing power. The broader the basket of commodities against which the currency is backed, the more stable the value of that currency will be and the more highly correlated it will be with growth in the economy overall.

But deflation can be worse; even modest deflation can set in motion a cascade of adverse economic responses. Sure, it may seem great that the price of a beer is falling between rounds. If that were the case, your income would probably be falling, too. No tragedy yet—your income is falling and so are the prices of the things you typically buy. But now imagine that your debts are not falling. The bank still expects the same mortgage payment every month, even as your paycheck shrinks steadily. Welcome to the Great Depression.

The relationship between the money supply and prices is also affected by the speed with which money circulates in the economy, or the “velocity” of money. Velocity is prone to be higher—a single dollar will circulate quickly through the economy—when consumers and firms have less need or desire to hang on to cash (and assets that approximate cash, such as checking account deposits).

Velocity is the crucial link between money supply and prices. Anything that causes individuals and institutions to hang on to money will slow velocity. For example, economic uncertainty prompts banks, firms, and consumers to stockpile cash (and other liquid assets†) because they fear less access to credit in the future. On the other hand, financial innovations that make it easier to convert assets to cash, such as home equity loans, speed up velocity because they enable households to hold less money for a rainy day (or, more accurately, a hurricane that blows off the roof). For all that, short-term fluctuations in velocity can still be puzzling.

At the same time, the U.S. dollar is the best form of currency one might conceive. It is widely accepted and has a predictable purchasing power against a broad basket of goods. In that respect, the dollar is better than gold or silver (or mackerel) because it is less prone to swings in value, particularly deflation. A responsible central bank can grow the money supply at whatever rate produces stable prices. In times of economic distress, the right number of clicks on a keyboard at the right time can save jobs and raise incomes.

The key to making the Consumer Price Index relevant and accurate is identifying the basket of goods most relevant for most American households.7 In this respect, the Bureau of Labor Statistics really is like the CIA. Field agents send raw data back to headquarters where it is analyzed to find meaningful patterns. Specifically, BLS statisticians use expenditure data for a representative sample of families to determine the most appropriate basket of goods for the typical American household. At present, that basket consists of more than two hundred categories of goods and services in eight broad groups: food and beverages, housing, apparel, recreation, and so on.

When calculating the CPI, each item is weighted based on its share in the basket of goods. If the typical household spends three times as much on fresh chicken as it does on Parmesan cheese, then any change in the price of chicken will affect the CPI three times as much as a change in the price of Parmesan cheese. (In the Christmas Price Index, the annual change in the price of lords a-leaping is weighted ten times as heavily as the price of a partridge in a pear tree, since your true love sends you ten lords a-leaping and only one partridge in a pear tree.) The end product is the most commonly cited inflation measure in the United States: the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which captures the spending patterns of about 88 percent of the American population.8 (A related index, the CPI-W, covers Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, which represent 32 percent of the population.) As both names would suggest, this still leaves out rural households, whose basket of goods and shopping options are appreciably different from those of households in metropolitan areas. Nor does it measure regional variations in consumption patterns and prices. The Bureau of Labor Statistics warns, “The CPI frequently is called a cost-of-living index, but it differs in important ways from a complete cost-of-living measure.”

In theory, if a car is 7 percent more expensive and also 7 percent “better” (safer or more dependable or more comfortable), the price has not gone up. How exactly does one quantify how much better a car is because it now has antilock brakes and audio controls on the steering wheel? In what the Wall Street Journal has described as “a warren of beige-walled cubicles at the Bureau of Labor Statistics,” some forty commodity specialists make these determinations.

If our goal is to measure changes in the cost of living, obviously we have to measure changes in prices—but also changes in consumption patterns induced by those higher or lower prices. Yes, my Social Security check ought to get bigger if the stuff I typically buy gets more expensive; however, that bigger check ought to be offset somewhat if I buy less of the stuff that is getting more expensive—fewer oranges and more bananas. Failure to take this behavioral change into account will overstate the true rise in the cost of living.

Consumers typically respond to rising prices in three ways, all of which the CPI failed to capture fully. First, they find cheaper places to buy the same product. (This was a particularly salient point because the Boskin Commission report coincided with the spread of outlets and superstores.) They also substitute across products (bananas for apples). And then they substitute within product categories (Gala apples for Red Delicious).

There is also agreement that deflation should never have to happen, as every modern economy has a fiat currency that can be printed on demand. Ben Bernanke once famously suggested that falling prices in Japan could be fixed easily by dropping money out of helicopters. (This was a metaphor, not a literal policy suggestion.) Deflation is like a disease that can be cured by eating pizza and ice cream while watching TV on the couch; we would not expect it to afflict the country for a long time.

Printing more money diminishes the value of the money already in circulation, which is effectively a tax on that currency. Economists refer to this phenomenon as “seignorage,” which reflects the difference between the cost of producing money (essentially zero in the modern era) and the value of that new money. Seignorage is like the host of the poker game who reaches into the closet to get more plastic chips for himself without putting any more cash in the shoebox. He gets richer at the expense of everyone else holding chips.

In fact, there is a human tendency to prefer getting a raise, even when inflation eats away all the benefit. And we abhor getting a pay cut, even when falling prices might compensate for some or all of the smaller check. Economists describe this tendency to think in nominal terms, rather than real (inflation-adjusted) terms, as “money illusion.”

The financial system amplifies booms and busts, primarily because of the “procyclical” nature of credit. Banks lend most aggressively when times are good and most cautiously when times are bad—which makes the good times better and the bad times worse.

Aside from actual dollars, which are impractical for holding large sums, U.S. Treasury securities are the world’s most liquid asset. Roughly half a trillion dollars’ worth of Treasury bonds are bought and sold every day.18 Liquidity is a continuum, with cash on one end and unique assets, such as fine art, on the other. Every Rembrandt painting is unique; the number of potential buyers is small. It takes time to arrange such a sale, and the commission for selling such a work tends to be high. If you need to raise a large amount of cash in the next fifteen minutes, selling Treasuries is a perfectly viable option—selling a Swiss ski chalet or a vintage baseball card collection less so.§

Solvency, on the other hand, is a binary concept. An entity is solvent if its assets exceed its liabilities; it is insolvent (broke, bankrupt) if its liabilities are more than its assets. Even if all the assets can be liquidated quickly and easily, the revenue generated is not sufficient to pay off all the creditors. But here’s the thing: assets that are liquid in normal times are not liquid in a crisis because so many people are trying to sell the same thing at the same time. Even if your balance sheet is healthy, assuming that you can sell assets to survive a financial panic is like assuming you can run to the grocery store to get water during a hurricane.

The role of a central bank is typically threefold: to manage the money supply; to act as a lender of last resort; and to regulate the financial industry. (The regulatory responsibility is often shared with other arms of government.)

central banks can also commit monetary malpractice. Zimbabwe’s central bank wrecked the economy with too much money; in the United States during the 1930s, the relatively young Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to shrink precipitously, turning what might have been a routine economic downturn into the Great Depression. Yes, a doctor can cure cancer; he can also amputate the wrong limb. So it is with central bankers.

A central bank can also loan funds directly to the banking system through a mechanism called the “discount window.” The Fed is the lender of last resort; as the name would suggest, banks are encouraged to go elsewhere first. The interest rate at which the Fed will loan funds directly to banks, the discount rate, is typically set slightly above the market rate at which banks borrow from one another.‡ Historically there has been not only a small pecuniary penalty for borrowing from the central bank but also a stigma. Borrowing from the Fed is like borrowing money from your parents once you are over thirty. You can do it, but everyone involved would prefer that you found the funds somewhere else. The Fed’s discount lending adheres to Walter Bagehot’s admonition that a lender of last resort ought to lend freely at a punitive rate. At the height of the financial crisis, both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, two of America’s preeminent investment banks, legally converted themselves into traditional bank holding companies in part so that they would have access to emergency lending from the Fed.

Enigma variations Alibaba tweaks a controversial legal structure Jack Ma’s role in the firm’s “variable interest entities” will be reduced Aug 9th 2018 IF YOU want to study how the legal title to assets worth many billions of dollars changes hands in China, then peer carefully at page 116 of Alibaba’s new annual report. The text is dense and you may have to put a cold towel on your head and read it several times. The gist is that the Chinese internet giant is reforming its legal structure, which uses a fragile and ingenious device known as a variable interest entity (VIE). Alibaba’s attempt to make its VIEs safer is to be welcomed and will be watched closely by China’s richest entrepreneurs, many of whom use them, too. VIEs are ubiquitous, especially among the country’s internet firms, which have a total market capitalisation of over $1trn. The structure dates back to the early 2000s, when Chinese technology companies wanted to tap global capital markets in New York and Hong Kong and to set up international holding companies domiciled outside of mainland China. Yet their sensitive internet assets, such as licences, may not be owned by foreign entities, according to Chinese law. To get around this, tech firms opted to avoid owning these mainland assets outright, and instead to bundle them into legal entities called VIEs, in turn owned by individuals in China (usually the bosses of the firms and their associates). The VIEs and these individuals sign contracts with the international holding company, handing over to it control of the VIE as well as its profits. This approach remains popular. For example, it is being used by Xiaomi, a tech firm which did a blockbuster initial public offering in Hong Kong this year. There are three problems with VIEs. First, key-man risk. If the people with nominal title die, divorce or disappear, it is not certain that their heirs and successors can be bound to follow the same contracts. Second, it is not clear if the structure is even legal. China’s courts have set few reliable precedents on VIEs and the official position is one of toleration rather than approval. Third, VIEs allow China’s leading tech firms to be listed abroad, preventing mainlanders from easily owning their shares and participating in their success. Alibaba’s proposed change is aimed at tackling the first problem, key-man risk. At the moment four of its five VIEs are nominally owned by Jack Ma, the firm’s leader, and Simon Xie, a co-founder and former employee. After the restructuring, the two men will no longer be the dominant counterparties. Instead the VIEs will be owned by two layers of holding companies, which will sign contracts with Alibaba. These holding companies will ultimately be nominally owned by a broader group of Alibaba’s senior Chinese staff. The idea is that if anyone gets run over by a bus, then the scheme will not be disrupted, because nominal control is spread among a wider group of people. The new approach is far from perfect but it is an improvement. If all goes to plan it will be completed by 2019. Other tech firms may feel pressure to follow. The other two problems with VIEs remain, however. All firms still carry warnings in their annual reports that the legality of VIEs is uncertain. And mainlanders cannot own shares easily. When Xiaomi floated in Hong Kong in June its plan was that they could buy stock in two ways. They could purchase depositary receipts (which give the rights to the underlying share) that would be listed in Shanghai, or they could buy shares in Hong Kong through “stock connect”, a programme allowing a limited volume of trading between the mainland and Hong Kong. Unfortunately the listing of depositary receipts fell through, for reasons that remain unclear. Then mainland regulators decided that firms with dual share classes, including Xiaomi, would not be eligible for stock connect (the Chinese authorities and Hong Kong’s exchange are holding negotiations to try to resolve this). China talks a good game about financial reform but its fiddly rules and opaque decision-making are a source of risk and ambiguity—even for its most successful companies.

In the aggregate, the exchange rate between two currencies—the price at which one currency can be exchanged for another—will reflect supply and demand. If a huge number of Americans (holding dollars) suddenly want more Mexican pesos, the demand for pesos relative to dollars will go up, meaning that the “price” of pesos in dollars will climb. An economist would say that the peso has appreciated relative to the dollar, but really the price of that currency has gone up for the same reason roses are more expensive on Valentine’s Day: people are willing to give up more dollars to get them. If you want to sound fancy about it, you can say roses have appreciated relative to dollars.

Yes, gold exists in finite supply, but that in no way guarantees stable prices. If the quantity of gold coming out of the ground grows faster than the rest of the economy, prices (in gold) will typically rise. If growth in the supply of gold lags behind the rest of the economy, gold will become relatively more valuable and prices will fall. This was Keynes’s critique—though really it is just basic supply and demand.

The reality is that the real estate bubble inspired people and businesses to borrow heavily to buy properties they erroneously believed would not fall significantly in value. Without that fundamental error in judgment, the rest of the crisis could not have happened. The typical real estate purchase was far more leveraged than the stocks purchased on margin in the run up to the 1929 crash. Putting 5 percent down on a house means the other 95 percent is borrowed.

The two firms, known as government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, combined the worst of both worlds: the private sector hunt for profits with an implicit government guarantee if things went wrong. In 2005, Fannie and Freddie began buying and holding bundles of subprime mortgages—almost exactly at the peak of the real estate market. Suffice it to say, this turned out badly. In September 2008, the federal government took over both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after huge losses threatened to bankrupt them.

Last but not least, the firm AIG (American International Group) put the frosting on this poop cake by insuring some of the most exotic mortgage-related securities. Technically, AIG offered “credit default swaps,” which are promises to pay compensation in the event the issuer of a security defaults or misses a payment. Unlike regular forms of insurance, however, AIG was not required to set aside reserves against potential losses. When real estate prices were rising steadily, this was a great business—like writing hurricane insurance in Florida when it’s not hurricane season. What’s not to like about the steady flow of checks? But when the hurricane season arrived—the collapse of the real estate market—AIG was not able to make good on its promises. This, too, ended badly. In September 2008, the federal government seized control of AIG, providing $85 billion in new capital to keep it afloat.

But rather than rushing to the bank to make a withdrawal, they just stop renewing the overnight loans (or they demand much more collateral). This is when borrowing $100 million for ten years starts to feel very different than borrowing $100 million every day over and over again. Firms like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were borrowing short-term in the repo market to finance long-term operations. It would be like paying off your house by refinancing the mortgage every evening; if the value of the property drops, that refinancing gets a lot harder.

Yes, irresponsible lending and the securitization of bad loans amplified and spread the problem. But at the end of the day, this was an old-fashioned financial panic. Customers were not lined up outside of banks; instead firms and institutional investors were demanding their cash back from financial firms like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Citibank, and the other names you’ve seen in the news. As one witness told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, “The repo market, I mean it functioned fine up until one day it just didn’t function.”

For example, how many possible chess games can be played? A game can be declared a draw by either player after a triple repetition of a position, or when each has made 50 moves in a row without a pawn move or a capture, or when there are not enough pieces left to produce a checkmate. If we say that one of the two players must take advantage of this rule in every game where it comes up, then we can calculate the number of possible chess games. Rich Gott did this and found the answer was a number less than 10^(10^4.4). That’s a lot bigger than a googol, which is 10^(10^2).

I have a number still bigger than this. If a googol is 1 followed by 100 zeros, then how about 10 to the googol power? That has a name too: a googolplex. It is 1, with a googol of zeroes after it. Can you even write out this number? Nope. Because it has a googol of zeroes, and a googol is larger than the number of atoms in the universe. So you’re stuck writing it this way: 10googol, or 1010^100 or 10^(10^100). If you were so motivated, I suppose you could attempt to write 1019 zeros, on every atom in the universe.

Jacob Bekenstein invented a formula allowing us to estimate the maximum number of different quantum states that could have a mass and size comparable to our observable universe. Given the quantum fuzziness we observe, that would be the maximum number of distinct observable universes like ours. It’s 10^(10^124), a number that has 1024 times as many zeros as a googolplex. These 10^(10^124) universes range from ones that are scary, filled with mostly black holes, to ones that are exactly like ours but where your nostril is missing one oxygen molecule and some space alien’s nostril has one more.

To be suddenly left without any story is terrifying. Nothing makes any sense. A bit like the Soviet elite in the 1980s, liberals don’t understand how history deviated from its preordained course, and they lack an alternative prism to interpret reality. Disorientation causes them to think in apocalyptic terms, as if the failure of history to come to its envisioned happy ending can only mean that it is hurtling towards Armageddon.

The Sun heats the ground; the ground heats the air. The Sun does not appreciably heat the air itself, which is transparent to most of the energy that comes from the Sun. The Sun’s energy peaks in the visible part of the spectrum, and you already know that you can see the Sun through the atmosphere. From this we conclude the obvious fact that the Sun’s visible light is not being absorbed by the air, otherwise, you wouldn’t see the Sun at all.

Polaris is 90° up, and you’re at 90° latitude. Let’s go down to the equator. What’s the latitude of the equator? Zero degrees. Polaris is now on the horizon, 0° up. What’s my latitude in Princeton? Forty degrees. So, from Princeton, the altitude of Polaris is 40° above the horizon. People who navigate by the stars know that the altitude of Polaris you observe is equal to your latitude on Earth. Christopher Columbus set sail at a fixed latitude that he maintained for his entire journey across the Atlantic Ocean. Go back and look at his maps. That’s how they navigated; they kept at that latitude by keeping Polaris at the same altitude above the horizon during the trip.

Why don’t we have a lunar eclipse every month, when Earth is between the Sun and Moon like this? It is because the Moon’s orbit is tipped at about 5° relative to Earth’s orbit around the Sun. So, in most months, the Moon passes north or south of Earth’s shadow in space, preserving our normal view of the full Moon.

The Greek word planetos meant “wanderer.” To the ancient Greeks, Earth was not considered a planet, because we were at the center of the universe. And the Greeks recognized two other planets I haven’t listed; what would they be? They were also moving against the background stars: the Sun and the Moon. By the definition from ancient Greece, these were the seven planets. And the seven days of the week owe their names to the seven planets or the gods related to them. Some are obvious, like Sunday and Monday. Saturday is Saturn-day. You have to go to other languages to get the rest; we have Frigga for Friday, for example. Frigga (or sometimes Freyja) was the Norse goddess associated with Venus.

An object can be acted on by a variety of forces, but whatever those forces are, it is the sum of all the forces that causes a deviation from this uniform velocity. We use the term acceleration to quantify this deviation: acceleration is the change in velocity per unit of time. The second law, then, relates the acceleration of an object to a force acting on it. When you push an object with some force, the object will accelerate. If the object has a small mass, the acceleration will be large, whereas if it is very massive, the acceleration will be smaller for the same amount of force. This relationship gives us Newton’s most famous equation, F = ma; force equals mass times acceleration.

Consider an apple sitting in your hand. It is clearly sitting still. Does it have any forces acting on it? Yes, gravity from Earth. It should be accelerating downward, but clearly it’s not. The reason is that your hand is holding the apple, pushing upward on it (using your arm muscles). In response, by Newton’s third law, the apple is pushing down on your hand; that’s what we refer to as the apple’s weight. The gravitational force from Earth pulling downward on the apple and the force of your hand pushing back up on the apple balance each other out; the sum of these two forces is zero. Zero force means zero acceleration by Newton’s second law, so the apple, which starts at rest, is not going anywhere.

On an amusement ride, in contrast, we’re not going anywhere near 30 km/sec, but the radius r of the circle we’re moving around is tiny; when we divide by that small value of r in the formula v2/r, the resulting acceleration gets quite large, and we are immediately aware of the pull of this acceleration. (For example, a ride moving you at 10 meters per second with a radius of 10 meters, would give an acceleration of 10 meters per second per second.)

Earth is being accelerated toward the Sun by an amount v2/r. Newton then used Kepler’s third law to figure out how the acceleration produced by the Sun varies with radius. The orbital period P of the planet is P = (2πr/v); that is, the orbital period, P, is the distance the planet travels in completing one orbit (2πr) divided by its velocity (v). Thus, P is proportional to r/v, and P2 is proportional to r2/v2. Kepler told us that P2 is proportional to a3, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet’s orbit. In this case, Earth’s orbit is nearly circular, so we can say approximately that r = a, and therefore, substituting r for a, we find: P2 is proportional to r3. Since P2 is also proportional to r2/v2, r2/v2 is proportional to r3. Dividing by r, we get: r/v2 is proportional to r2. Inverting, we find, v2/r (the acceleration) is proportional to 1/r2. With these few steps of reasoning, Kepler’s third law, and a little algebra, we’ve shown that the gravitational acceleration, and thus the force, exerted by the Sun on a body at distance r away is proportional to one over the square of that distance: Newton’s “inverse-square” law of gravity.

What this means is that the acceleration of Earth (GMSun/r2 = v2/r) does not depend on Earth’s mass. That’s a remarkable fact. The acceleration of gravity does not depend on the mass of the object being accelerated, either for orbits around the Sun or for objects falling in Earth’s gravitational field, because the mass of the object appears on both sides of the F = ma equation and thus factors out.

You have probably seen images of astronauts in the International Space Station in orbit around Earth. Earth’s gravity is acting on the astronauts and the International Space Station alike. But everything in the space station is falling at the same rate—recall our calculation that the acceleration of gravity does not depend on the mass of the object in orbit. With everything falling at the same rate, the astronauts feel weightless. “Weight” means what a bathroom scale registers when you stand on it (or equivalently, how much the bathroom scale pushes back on you, by Newton’s third law). But if the scale is falling just as you are, you are not pushing down on the scale, and it registers your weight as zero. You are weightless.

Newton’s laws had another great success. The planet Uranus was not following Newton’s laws exactly; its orbit seemed to be perturbed. Urbain Le Verrier found that this could be explained if Uranus was being pulled by the gravity of another unseen planet farther out from the Sun. He predicted where this planet could be found, and in 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle and Heinrich Louis d’Arrest, using Le Verrier’s calculations, found it only 1° in the sky away from where Le Verrier had predicted it would be. Newton’s laws had been used to discover a new planet: Neptune. Newton’s reputation soared.

In case you ever encounter this term parsec, now you know where it comes from. Astronomers coined the word by combining those two other terms, parallax and arc second. A star that has a parallax of ½ arc second is 2 parsecs away. A star that has a parallax of 1/10 of an arc second is 10 parsecs away.

Alpha says it’s the brightest star of its constellation, the southern constellation Centaurus, but it’s actually a three-star system, one of whose stars is closest to our solar system. A triple star system—very cool. There is Alpha Centauri A, a solar-type star, 123% the diameter of the Sun; Alpha Centauri B, 86.5% the diameter of the Sun; and Proxima Centauri, a dim red star, only 14% the diameter of the Sun. Of these 3 stars, the one closest to our Sun is Proxima Centauri. That’s why we call it Proxima. Its distance from us is about 4.1 light-years, giving a parallax of 0.8 arc seconds.

You will find no one willing to share out his money; but to how many does each of us divide up his life!

‘Why do you launch your ships? Why do you arm your bands against both beasts and men? Why do you tear around in such a panic? Why do you pile wealth upon wealth? You really must consider how small your bodies are. Is it not madness and the worst form of derangement to want so much though you can hold so little? Therefore, though you may increase your income and extend your estates, you will never increase the capacity of your bodies. Though your business may do well and warfare bring you profit, though you hunt down and gather your food from every side, you will not have anywhere to store your supplies. Why do you seek out so many things?

Nature has not made any of man’s essentials laborious as well. But he must have richly dyed purple clothes, woven with gold thread and decorated with multicoloured patterns: it is his fault, not nature’s, if he feels poor. Even if you give him back all he has lost, you’ll be wasting your time; for once he is back from exile he will feel a greater lack compared with his desires than he felt as an exile compared with his former possessions

Nor is this true only of money or food: the same feature is found in every desire which arises not from a lack but from a vice. However much you heap up for it will not mark the end of greed, only a stage in it. So the man who restrains himself within the bounds set by nature will not notice poverty; the man who exceeds these bounds will be pursued by poverty however rich he is. Life’s necessities are found even in places of exile, superfluities not even in kingdoms. It is the mind that creates our wealth, and this goes with us into exile, and in the harshest desert places it finds sufficient to nourish the body and revels in the enjoyment of its own goods. Money in no way concerns the mind any more than it concerns the gods. All those things which are revered by minds untaught and enslaved to their bodies – marble, gold, silver, great round polished tables – are earthly burdens which a soul pure and conscious of its nature cannot love: for it is light and unencumbered, and destined to soar aloft whenever it is released from the body.

Dearest mother, since you have no cause on my account to drive you to endless tears it follows that reasons regarding yourself are urging you to weep. Well, there are two: you are bothered either because you seem to have lost some protection, or because you cannot endure the very thought of doing without me. The first point I must touch upon only slightly, for I know that your heart loves your dear ones for themselves alone. Let those mothers reflect on this who exploit their children’s influence with a woman’s lack of influence; who, because women cannot hold office, seek power through their sons; who both drain their sons’ inheritances and try to get them; who exhaust their sons by lending their eloquence to others. Whereas you have taken the greatest pleasure in your sons’ gifts and made the least use of them; you have always set a limit to our generosity without limiting your own; while your father was still alive you actually gave gifts to your wealthy sons; you administered our inheritances as though you were earnestly looking after your own and being scrupulously provident with another’s; you were cautious in using our influence, as if it were someone else’s, and in our spells in office you had no part except your pleasure and the expenses. Your love never had regard for self-interest: therefore, now that your son has been taken from you, you cannot feel the lack of those things which you never thought concerned you when he was safe and sound.

Telescopes weren’t invented yet, so they just looked very carefully, and kept on looking. No matter how hard they squinted, they couldn’t find any difference. In fact, because this effect couldn’t be measured without telescopes, they used it as potent evidence against the Sun-centered, heliocentric universe. But absence of evidence isn’t always the same as evidence of absence.

Among this zoo of stars, no matter where we find them, we search for and find stars of the same kind. So, if a star has some peculiar feature in its spectrum, and if a star of that same variety is close enough to observe its parallax, it’s a happy day. We can now calibrate the star’s luminosity and use it to find out whether other stars like it are one-fourth as bright or one-ninth as bright, and then we can calculate how far away they are. But we need that standard candle, that yardstick.

A photon is a particle. We can also think of it as being a wave, a wave–particle duality. Well, you say, which is it? Is it a wave or a particle? That question has no meaning. We should instead be asking ourselves why our brains can’t wrap themselves around something that has a dual reality inherent in it. That’s the problem. We could make up a word such as “wavicle.” This term was introduced some time ago, but it never caught on because people still want to know which it is. The answer depends on how you measure it. We can think of it as a wave, and waves have wavelengths.

Since we’re talking about microwaves, as it happens, the water molecule, H2O, is very responsive to microwaves; the microwaves in your microwave oven flip the molecule back and forth at the frequency of the wave itself. If you have a bunch of water molecules, they will all do it. Billions of trillions of them. Before long, the water gets hot because of the friction between the molecules as they undergo these flips. Anything you put in a microwave oven that has water in it will get hot. Everything you eat other than salt has water in it. That’s why microwave ovens are so effective at cooking your food, and why it doesn’t heat your glass plate if you don’t have food on it.

So high frequency corresponds to short wavelengths, and conversely, low frequencies correspond to longer wavelengths. It’s a perfect situation for an equation: the speed of light (c) equals frequency times wavelength (λ). For frequency, we use the Greek letter nu: ν. Our equation becomes c = νλ.

In fact, frequency and the energy in a photon are bound in an equation, too. The energy E of a photon is equal to hν: E = hν. Einstein discovered this equation. The equation uses Planck’s constant h, named for the German physicist Max Planck. It serves as a proportionality constant in the equation, telling us how the frequency and energy of a photon are related. The higher its frequency is, the higher the energy of an individual photon will be. While X-ray photons pack a large punch, radio wave photons each carry only a tiny amount of energy.

Therefore, the Sun, radiating roughly equal amounts of all these colors, gives us white light. No matter how the Sun is drawn in a textbook, no matter what people in the street tell you, we have a white star—it’s just that simple. By the way, if the Sun were truly yellow, then white surfaces would look yellow in full sunshine, and snow would look yellow (whether or not you were near a fire hydrant).

The Sun’s surface temperature is about 5,800 K. Temperature on the Kelvin scale (K) is Celsius (C) plus 273. Ice freezes at 0° C (or 273 K). Water boils at 100° C (or 373 K). Celsius and K values are separated by only 273, and as we get to higher and higher temperatures, tracking that difference becomes less and less meaningful. In any case, 5,800 K is very hot. It will vaporize you. And to round things out, 0 K (you may have heard it called absolute zero) is the coldest possible temperature. Molecular motion stops at 0 K.

an emission curve whose temperature is 2.7 K, which is the temperature of the whole universe! That’s the famous background radiation coming to us from all parts of the sky. Because it peaks in the microwave part of the spectrum, it is called the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It was discovered in New Jersey, at Bell Laboratories, in the mid-1960s. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson used a radio telescope—they called it the “microwave horn antenna.” When they aimed it up at the sky, no matter which direction they pointed, they detected this microwave signal, from everywhere in the sky, which corresponds to something radiating at a temperature of about 3 K (the modern, more accurate, value is 2.725 K). And it’s the thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang.

A blackbody is an object that absorbs all incident radiation. A blackbody that is at a certain temperature will emit what we call blackbody radiation, which follows the curves we’ve been showing. The term “blackbody” looks like a misnomer, but it is not. We agree that these stars aren’t black: one star glows blue, one star glows white, and one star glows red. Yet all qualify as blackbodies, as I’ve drawn them in the figure. A blackbody is quite simple; it eats any and all energy hitting it. I don’t care what you feed it—that doesn’t matter—it will eat it. You can feed it gamma rays or radio waves. Black things absorb all energy that falls on them. That’s why black clothing is not a common fashion option in the summer. Blackbodies then reradiate these curves—it is that simple. The curve’s shape and position depend only on the temperature of the blackbody.

I have a wonderful equation that describes these curves. They are distribution functions, called Planck functions, after Max Planck, whom we’ve met previously, and who was the first person to write down the equation for these curves. To the right of the equal sign, we have energy per unit time per unit area coming out per unit wavelength interval at a particular wavelength λ; we call this quantity intensity (Iλ), which depends only on the temperature T of the blackbody: Iλ(T) = (2hc2/λ5)/(ehc/λkT – 1)

Isaac Newton invented math that allowed you to figure out where a function peaks: it’s where the slope of the curve goes to zero at the curve’s maximum. You can use Newton’s calculus to take the derivative of the function and determine this location. When we do that, we get a very simple answer: λ peak = C/T, where C is a new constant, which we can find from the constants in the initial equation: C = 2.898 millimeters when T is expressed in kelvins. Where is the peak? If the temperature is T = 2.7 K, as in the CMB, then λ peak is a little over 1 millimeter or 0.1 centimeter. We can confirm this by checking the CMB curve in figure 5.1. The human is about a hundred times hotter than that; the human emission peaks at about 0.001 centimeter (also shown in figure 5.1), in the infrared.

It’s beautiful. As temperature gets higher, the wavelength at which the curve peaks gets smaller and smaller. That is borne out just by looking at how this equation λ peak = C/T behaves. With T in the denominator, it says that something twice as hot will peak at one-half the wavelength. (Wilhelm Wien figured this out—we call it “Wien’s Law.”)

If she had chanced to live in the days of old when people frankly admired heroism, how men of genius would have competed to sing the praises of a wife who ignored her physical weakness, ignored the sea which even the bravest must fear, and risked her life to give her husband burial; and while her thoughts were on his funeral had no fears about her own! All the poets have given renown to the woman who offered to die in place of her husband. But this is nobler, to risk one’s life to bury one’s husband: for that love is greater which wins less through equal danger.

since my mind, without any preoccupation, is free for its own tasks, now delighting in more trivial studies, now in its eagerness for the truth rising up to ponder its own nature and that of the universe. It seeks to know first about lands and their location, then the nature of the encompassing sea and its tidal ebb and flow. Then it studies all the awesome expanse which lies between heaven and earth – this nearer space turbulent with thunder, lightning, gales of wind, and falling rain, snow and hail. Finally, having scoured the lower areas it bursts through to the heights and enjoys the noblest sight of divine things and, mindful of its own immortality, it ranges over all that has been and will be throughout all ages.

history is the story of mankind, of what it has done, suffered or enjoyed. We all know that dogs and cats do not have histories, while human beings do. Even when historians write about a natural process beyond human control, such as the ups and downs of climate, or the spread of a disease, they do so only because it helps us to understand why men and women have lived (and died) in some ways rather than others.

What is surely and identifiably unique about the human species is not its possession of certain faculties or physical characteristics, but what it has done with them. That, of course, is its history. Humanity’s unique achievement is its remarkably intense level of activity and creativity, its cumulative capacity to create change. All animals have ways of living, some complex enough to be called cultures. Human culture alone is progressive; it has been increasingly built by conscious choice and selection within it as well as by accident and natural pressure, by the accumulation of a capital of experience and knowledge which man has exploited.

Climate was the first great pacemaker of change. About 65 million years ago – an early enough point at which to begin to grapple with our story – a long warm climatic phase began to draw to a close. It had favoured the great reptiles and during it Antarctica had separated from Australia. There were no ice-fields then in any part of the globe. As the world grew colder and the new climatic conditions restricted their habitat, the great reptiles did not manage to adapt, though it is likely that it was a sudden event – the impact of a giant asteroid – that killed them off completely. But the new conditions suited other animal strains which were already about, among them some mammals whose tiny ancestors had appeared 200 million years or so earlier. They now inherited the earth, or a considerable part of it. With many breaks in sequence and accidents of selection on the way, these strains were themselves to evolve into the mammals which occupy our own world – ourselves included.

One hundred million or so years ago, primitive mammals were of two main sorts. Some, rodent-like, remained on the ground; others took or had taken to the trees. In this way the competition for resources was lessened and strains of each survived to people the world with the creatures we know today. In the second group were the prosimians. We are among their descendants, for they were the ancestors of the first primates.

Some 25 or 30 million years ago, as desiccation began to reduce the area of the forests, competition for diminishing forest resources became fiercer. Environmental challenge and opportunity appeared where the trees and the grasslands met. Some primates, not powerful enough to hold on to their forest homes, were able, because of some genetic quality, to penetrate the savannahs in search of food and could meet the challenge and exploit the opportunities. Probably they had a posture and movement marginally more like that of men than, say, that of the gorillas or chimpanzees.

It is likely that the separation of these groups was a relatively slow process, occurring over millions of years, with episodes of interbreeding taking place.

They belong to the family now called Australopithecus. The earliest fragments of their fossils have been identified as over 4 million years old, but the oldest complete skull and a nearly complete skeleton found near Johannesburg in 1998 are probably at least half-a-million years ‘younger’ than that. This is not very different (allowing for the generous stretches of time and approximation available in prehistoric chronology) from the dating of ‘Lucy’, formerly the most complete specimen of Australopithecus discovered (in Ethiopia). Evidence of other species of ‘australopithecines’ (as they are usually termed), found as far apart as Kenya and the Transvaal, can be dated to various periods over the next 2 million years and has had a great impact upon archaeological thinking.

When we fall asleep, the pons initiates dreaming by sending signals through the mammal brain to the primate brain, where dreams stir to life. During dreams, the pons also dispatches a message to the spinal cord beneath it, which produces chemicals to make your muscles flaccid.

On a deeper level, Henri’s death helped inaugurate a new approach to neuroscience. You can’t call Vesalius and Paré modern: each revered Galen along with Hippocrates and the rest of the Greek medical chorus. But each of them also evolved past the ancients, by emphasizing experiments and observation. Vesalius bequeathed a new map of the brain, Paré new diagnoses and surgical techniques; and while Henri’s was not the first autopsy, in terms of prestige—prestige of both the patient and the practitioners—it was the summa of early medical science. The treatment of royals often defined what became standard care for everyone else, and after Henri’s death, autopsies started to spread throughout Europe. This expansion made it easier to correlate specific brain damage with altered behavior, and with every new autopsy, neuroscientists learned to pinpoint people’s symptoms more precisely.

By the later 1800s most biologists believed in “cell theory”—the idea that living creatures are composed entirely of tiny, squishy bricks called cells. Neuroscientists weren’t so sure. Discrete cells might exist in the rest of the body, yes. But under the microscope, neurons seemed to have no breaks or gaps between them; instead, they seemed fused together into one large, lacy net. Moreover, neuroscientists believed that—unlike other, more autonomous cells—neurons acted in unison as well, pulsing and thinking as one. They called this big net of neurons the neural reticulum.

Anatomically, the brain contains two distinct substances, gray matter and white matter. Gray matter has a high percentage of neurons, and most gray matter resides on the brain’s surface, in a wrinkly rind called the cortex. (Or at least most gray matter resides near the surface: two-thirds of the cortex is actually invisible from the outside, being corrugated and folded up just beneath the surface.

These findings led Cajal to propose the “neuron doctrine,” one of the most important discoveries ever in neuroscience. In brief, Cajal’s neurons were not continuous, but had tiny gaps between them. And they transmitted information in one direction only: from dendrite to cell body to axon. That is, no matter the signal (food! tiger! hubba-hubba!), it always entered a neuron through its dendrites; passed through the cell body for processing; and only then shunted down the axon. (I think of this progression, reverse-alphabetically, as d → cb → a.) When the signal reached the axon tip, the neuron then tickled the dendrites of the next neuron in line, and the process started over. Golgi might have seen the true shape of neurons first, but Cajal first determined how those silhouettes worked.

Most important: if neurons were separate, how exactly did a signal cross the gap between them? There seemed just two possibilities, electric currents or chemical pulses. Once again, each side in this battle had its partisans and stalwarts, with the “sparks” championing electricity and the “soups” championing a mélange of biochemicals.

To wit: Whenever a neuron “fires,” an electrical signal goes rippling down its axon to the axon tip—that’s the electricity that the sparks had detected long ago. But electricity cannot jump between cells, not even across the 0.000001-inch-wide synapse separating one neuron from another. So the axon must translate the electrical message into chemicals, which can cross the chasm. Like a chemical supply depot, the axon tip stores and manufactures all sorts of different neurotransmitters. And depending on the message it needs to convey, the tip will package certain ones into tiny bubbles. These bubbles then dump their contents into the synapse, allowing the neurotransmitters to stream across the gap and connect with the dendrites of nearby neurons. This docking triggers those neurons to send an electrical signal down their own axons. At this point, with the message delivered, cleanup begins. Nearby glial cells start to remove excess neurotransmitter molecules from the synapse, either by vacuuming them up or releasing predator enzymes to shred them. This effectively resets the synapse so the neuron can fire again. All this happens within milliseconds.

That said, the soup aspect has proved far more complex. The brain contains hundreds of types of neurons, all of which fire the same basic way electricity-wise. As a result, electrical signals can’t convey much nuance. But neurons use over one hundred different neurotransmitters* to convey various subtleties of thought.

Napoleon the Kingmaker The period after 1789 has been so often labelled an age of revolution that its character as an apogee of monarchy has been ignored. Yet, unlike those of 1830 and 1848, the revolution of 1789 inspired more revulsion than imitation From Naples to St Petersburg rulers previously interested in reforms reverted to conservatism. The Habsburg monarchy, under Joseph II in the vanguard of Enlightenment, became a citadel of censorship and repression: in 1798 a Viennese crowd attacked the house of the first ambassador from the French Republic simply for flying the Tricolour. England was swept by Loyalist movements convinced of the truth of Thomas Rowlandson’s famous cartoon of 1792. The Contrast, which depicted ‘British Liberty’ above the caption ‘National Prosperity and Happiness’, in contrast to the figure of ‘French Liberty’ representing National and Private Ruin’ and ‘Misery’. Russia provides the clearest example of the increase in authoritarian monarchy. An emphasis on discipline and order replaced Catherine’s efforts to promote local initiative and participation. In 1796-97, in the first year of Paul I’s reign, according to one of his secretaries, he issued 48,000 orders, rules and laws. The new Tsar also initiated the return to grandeur which was a feature of nineteenth-century courts, after the fashion for such royal retreats as the Hermitage, the Trianon and Joseph II’s pavilion in the Augarten. On May 4th, 1797, the imperial ambassador Count Cobenzl wrote that Paul I had multiplied: …so far as it has been possible the occasions for grand etiquette and representation on the throne. It is unbelievable to what degree Paul I loves great ceremonies, the importance which he attaches to them and the time which he employs for them. No mere brushing of the lips, but full formal kissing of the imperial hand, was demanded from his officials. The central moment of his day, whatever the temperature, was the guard parade. It was at once an endurance test, the chief ceremony of state and a means by which Paul I exerted direct control over his officers and his empire. During his reign three regiments and his own 2,400 ‘Gatchina troops’ were added to the Imperial Guard. According to his biographer Roderick McGrew, Paul ‘pointed society, with the state in the vanguard, towards a severely hierarchical and essentially militarised mode of organisation’. Thus when Bonaparte seized power in 1799, while much of Europe had been conquered by the armies of the French Republic, the powers united against it in the Second Coalition were more monarchical and conservative than before. Earlier than is generally thought, the First Consul Bonaparte aligned himself with this monarchical costumes (1800-2), a dynasty (1804), finally a nobility (1808). By January 3rd, 1800, the Garde des Consuls, created in November 1799, numbered 2,089 – more than Louis XVI’s Garde Constitionelle of 1792. From the beginning it was an elitist unit with taller men, more splendid uniforms, and privileges of pay and rank over line units. On February 10th, 1800, escorted by his guard, Bonaparte moved in the Tuileries palace. He soon established what the architect Pierre Fontaine called ‘the magnificence due to his rank’. The weekly, later monthly, reviews which Bonaparte held in the Tuileries courtyard, riding a white horse which had once belonged to Louis XVI, inspired widespread admiration, not least from Paul I. According to one English visitor ‘their presence alone maintains public tranquility and causes a sensation’.  An Austrian later called such a review ‘the finest military spectacle it is possible to see’.  In the autumn of 1800, as he withdrew from the Second Coalition, Paul I suggested that Bonaparte make the throne of France hereditary in his family. The Hofburg, rather than Versailles, was the model for the regular receptions which Bonaparte began to hold in the Tuileries, and after the autumn of 1802 at St Cloud.  Rank at the French court was now based on service to the state rather than noble birth, and was revealed by space not time; by which room an officer or official could enter in the state apartments, rather than what time a courtier could enter the king’s bedroom.  Officers down to the rank of captain were admitted into the fourth room before the Salle des Consuls, field officers into the third, generals into the second, ambassadors into the first.  The English traveller, J.G. Lemaistre, who attended one of these receptions, wrote on March 7th, 1802: ‘persons used to courts all agree that the audience of the First Consul is one of the most splendid things of the kind in Europe’.  Bonaparte both employed ‘all the requisites of show, parade, form and etiquette’, and received ‘flattery and cringing attention’. *** Bonaparte’s costume, as well as his guard and his receptions, revealed his monarchical ambitions.  Heavily embroidered official uniforms were created in December 1799 for the consuls and ministers, and in May 1800 for prefects and senators.  At a reception in the Tuileries after Bonaparte’s review of the guard in March 1802, J.G. Lemaistre admired his ‘grand costume of scarlet velvet richly embroidered with gold’ and ‘the handsome uniforms and commanding figures of the soldiery… the consular guards are the handsomest men I ever saw, scarcely any are less than six feet high’.  He also wrote of foreign visitors, ‘everyone not in uniform is in the full dress of the old court’. For Bonaparte’s court was already in some ways more old-fashioned than the other courts. ‘The full dress of the old court’, which was imposed at receptions for foreigners and Frenchmen without official positions, was more common in 1802 than it would be after 1814 under the Restoration.  Foreigners bought their court dress in Paris, since elsewhere on the Continent it had, with a few exceptions, been abandoned.  In 1800, in a gesture revealing desire at once for trade, splendour and peace, the city of Lyon had presented the First Consul with a cherry velvet babit a la francaise, embroidered with olive branches in gold and silver thread.  Bonaparte wore this costume in preference to his official First Consul’s uniform at the Te Deum for the signature of the Concordat with the pope at Notre Dame on April 18th, 1802, and subsequently on the other state occasions.  He later devised a special lace and and velvet court costume for himself, the petit costume de l’Empereur, such as no other monarch possessed.  Costume was an instrument of power. When a group of men dared visit the Second Consul Cambaceres, future Archichancelier de l'Empire, in black tail coats, he asked: 'Are you in mourning? I would like to express my sympathy for the loss you have suffered'. The proclamation of the empire in May 1804, the establishment of the households of the Emperor, the Empress and the Imperial Family in July, the coronation by the pope in December of that year, were confirmations of an existing monarchical reality. From the start members of the old nobility - Segur, Talleyrand, Rohan, La Rochefoucauld – were among the court officials, as they had been among the first government officials nominated in 1800. Napoleon never wavered on such gains of the Revolution as equality before the law, religious toleration, the confiscation and sale of ecclesiastical property, and careers open to talents (although between 1805 and 1814 the proportion of non-nobles in court office fell by half). However, at the same time as he extended French territory by force of arms, Napoleon extended the principle of monarchy by imperial decree. He personally organised the destruction of the last city states in Europe. Already in 1797, after a thousand years, Venetian independence had been abolished on his orders; Genoa also lost its independence for ever in 1805, when the Ligurian Republic was annexed to the French Empire. In 1805, when Napoleon crowned himself king in Milan cathedral, the Italian Republic became the Kingdom of Italy with its own viceroy, Eugene de Beauharnais, its own court and nobility. One of the best surviving examples of a Napoleonic palace interior can be seen In Venice, in what is now the Museo Correr on the Piazza San Marco; from 1807 to 1814 it served as one of Napoleon's palaces as King of Italy. In 1805 another ancient urban republic, Dubrovnik, which had recently experienced a commercial renaissance, was also abolished and annexed to the Kingdom of Italy. The same year the Republic of Lucca – a free city since the twelfth century ~ became a principality under Napoleon's brother-in-law Felix Baciocchi, who was crowned in pomp in Lucca cathedral on July 14th, 1805. In 1806, acting as self-appointed overlord of Europe, Napoleon transformed the Batavian Republic, one of the bastions of European bourgeois life, into the Kingdom of Holland, under his brother Louis-Napoleon. Despite murmurs from the citizens, the great symbol of seventeenth-century urban prosperity and independence, the Town Hall of Amsterdam, became a Royal Palace, as it still is; one of the buildings attractions was that the square in front could contain 5,000 soldiers to subdue any potential popular disturbance. Meanwhile, King Louis-Napoleon introduced court costumes for the first time into the Netherlands: 'the intention seems to be to compensate them for never having worn embroider)' in this country' wrote Stanislas de Girardin, a chamberlain of Napoleon. In 1806, Napoleon transformed another great commercial city, Frankfurt, self-governing since the twelfth century, into the capital of a Grand Duchy under the last Archbishop Elector of Mainz, whom Napoleon had appointed Prince Primate of the Confederation of the Rhine. His heir was Eugene de Beauhamais, so that the expected second son of Napoleon I could become King of Italy. The same year, again acting as self-appointed overlord of Europe, the Emperor of the French elevated his allies, the rulers of Bavaria, Wurttemberg and Saxony, to the rank of King, and the rulers of Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt to that of Grand Duke. Absorbing free cities, and independent ecclesiastical and noble territories, these monarchs enjoyed more power during and after the Napoleonic era than they had under the Holy Roman Empire. Further extensions of monarchy occurred when the Septinsular republic of the Ionian islands, established by the Second Coalition in 1799, was annexed to the French Empire in 1807, as were the free cities of Hamburg, Liibeck and Bremen in 1810. Foreign conquests not only helped Napoleon extend monarchy in Europe but also helped him strengthen monarchy within his empire. Both the territorial titles of the noblesse d'empire created in 1808, and the domains and revenues assigned with them, were based on locations outside France. Hugues Maret, the Emperor's trusted Ministre secretaire d'Etat, for example, became Duke of Bassano in northern Italy, while Joseph Fouche, Minister of Police, became Duke of Otranto in the Kingdom of Naples. In 1810, Napoleon married the Archduchess Marie Louise, the last of the nine marriages - to the Houses of Bavaria (twice), Baden, Wurttemberg, Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Salm-Salm, von der Leyen and Arenberg - by which he connected members of his family, his marshals or their relations, with dynastic Europe. The imperial household, rather than the Senate, the Corps Legislatif and the Conseil d'Etat, became the power-centre of the state, the Etiquette du Palais imperial a clearer guide to the power structure than the written constitution. The Emperor's lever and coucher became critical moments, as Louis XVI's had not been, used by ambitious courtiers, such as the chamberlain Stanislas de Girardin (who was ultimately successful), to restate their candidacy for a prefecture. In 1810 dukes obtained the entrée to the throne-room, while presidents of sections in the Council of State lost it. Count Regnault de Saint Jean d'Angely, Secretary of State of the Imperial Family, wrote to Cardinal Fesch on October 4th, 1810: ...the ministers and grand officers of the Empire are also part of the Household of the emperor...This practice is consistent with the practice of the former French monarchy and the current practice of the other courts of Europe, By September 1813 so many chamberlains were serving as officers in the army or prefects in the departements that not enough were available for duty at court. In addition the Emperor used his ADCs to check and control the power and patronage of the Minister of War. Ultra-monarchical etiquette was used to assert the Emperor's superiority over the Senate, the Corps Legislatif and the city of Paris - even, to the Representatives' fury, during the Hundred Days. Echoing many Parisians, Madame de Boigne wrote of Napoleon that she had never seen a monarch treat the public so cavalierly - by his failure to salute or bow to his subjects. Stendhal, who often attended court between 1810 and 1814 as 'inspector of the furniture and buildings of the crown', wrote in 1818 of] ...this court devoured with ambition  [whose] pestilential air... totally corrupted Napoleon, and exalted his armour propre  to the state of a disease... he was on the point of making Europe one vast monarchy. Indeed by 1812, Napoleon owned forty-four palaces, from Rome to Amsterdam, more than any other monarch; when the restoration begun in 1808 had been completed, he was also planning to use Versailles, which he inspected several times. As one of his secretaries Baron Meneval wrote, he saw himself as 'the pillar of royalty in Europe'. On January 18th, 1813, he wrote to his brother Jerome that his enemies, by appealing to popular feeling, represented 'upheavals and revolutions... pernicious doctrines.’ *** In Napoleon's opinion his fellow monarchs were traitors to 'their own cause' when in 1813 they began to desert the French Empire, or in 1814 refused to accept his territorial terms for peace. However, like the Kaiser in 1914, he over-estimated their commitment to authoritarian monarchy. Most monarchs admired Napoleon's genius, his skill at taming the Revolution, the excellence of his guard and army, the splendour of his court and palaces. They were ready to Imitate Napoleonic models in those domains and to travel long distances to pay him court at Erfurt in 1808, Paris in 1809 and Dresden in 1812. In 1811 Metternich, a particular admirer of Napoleonic autocracy, thought of using French troops to suppress the Hungarian constitution. In 1813 both the King of Prussia and the Emperor of Austria dreaded war and hesitated to appeal to popular nationalism. However, most monarchs feared Napoleonic expansion more than they admired Napoleonic autocracy. Moreover, there was a monarchical alternative to Napoleon 1. In Vienna, Saint Petersburg and London there flourished what Count S. Uvarov, future minister of education in Russia, but long resident in Vienna, called 'that sort of open conspiracy... that great war machine... the secret alliance of European opinion against the France of the time'. He was referring to networks of dedicated opponents of French expansion, united by feelings of European solidarity. They included the great writer Madame de Stael; Baron von Stein the Prussian reformer; Baron von Armfelt, a confidante of Alexander 1; Count Pozzo di Borgo, one of his ADCs and the oldest and most implacable enemy of Napoleon since their youth on the island of Corsica; General Moreau, Napoleon's rival of 1800-04; and in Austrian service the great publicist, later called 'the Secretary of Europe', Friedrich von Gentz. They helped push Austria to attack the Napoleonic Empire in 1809, the Tsar to maintain resistance in 1812, and Bernadotte to join, that year, what Madame de Stael called 'the European cause.' Some of these enemies of Napoleon had personal connections with the Bourbon émigré government which, from 1798 if not before, both the British and Russian governments had kept as a reserve card in their plans for redrawing the map of Europe. As Pitt had told the House of Commons in 1800, the British government considered: 'the Restoration of the French monarchy... as a most desirable object because I think it would afford the strongest and best security to this country and to Europe' - although it was never a sine qua non of peace. The reappearance of the Bourbon dynasty on the European stage owed less to respect for its dynastic rights than to its commitment to France's traditional frontiers. This renunciation of territorial expansion, first evident at the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, was maintained throughout the reign of Louis XVI (Vergennes wrote to Louis XVI in 1777, ‘France as it is now constituted should far more fear than desire additional territory') and was repeatedly asserted in Louis XVIII's proclamations and letters. Even Napoleon, who continued to insist on retaining Antwerp and the 'natural frontiers', called a return to the 'old frontiers' 'inseparable from the re-establishment of the Bourbons'. This was the principal reason why Britain supported the Bourbons with money, asylum for Louis XVIII after 1807, assistance In distributing his proclamations in Prance and active encouragement for his nephew the Due d'Angouleme behind British lines in south-west France in March 1814. Like both Catherine II and Paul I, Tsar Alexander I remained more sympathetic to the Bourbon cause than Is generally believed. His court, like the Swedish, went into mourning for the Bourbon prince, the Duc d'Enghien, executed on Napoleon's orders in 1804, and refused to recognise Napoleon's imperial title until 1807. Although opposed to fighting a war for the sole object of the restoration of the King of France, in 1805 he considered the restoration of a Bourbon with a constitution 'highly desirable'. Throughout the years of peace with Napoleon after the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, the Russian government continued diplomatic contacts with, and paid a subsidy to, Louis XVIII. In a private audience in May 1813, Alexander I told the Comte de La Ferronays, a representative of Louis XVIII, that he was prepared to consider supporting a Restoration, once allied armies had crossed the Rhine; 'Let us let circumstances do the work. I know better than anyone, believe me, that the re-establishment of legitimacy is the only base on which one can establish the peace and tranquility of Europe'. To Louis XVIII he wrote 'we need patience, circumspection and the greatest secrecy’. Pozzo di Borgo was one of several royalist ADCs of the Tsar at allied headquarters from January to June 1814. In April, assisted by the growth of anti-Napoleonic feeling in France, and the Tsar's secret inclination, Pozzo insisted on the restoration of the Bourbons and Napoleon's abdication. It may have been Pozzo who suggested Elba, an island he knew well, as Napoleon's compensation. *** As the Bourbons had found during their emigration, so Napoleon learnt in 1814: territorial interests mattered more than blood connections to what Marshal Bernadotte called 'the family of kings'. To Napoleon's surprise, after 1814 Francis I of Austria showed no more support for the dynastic interests of his grandson the King of Rome than the Bourbons of Spain, Naples or Parma had done, after 1793, for those of their French cousins. Francis I wrote to Metternich of Napoleon's exile to Elba (formerly subject to his brother the Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany); The island of Elba does not please me, for it is a loss to Tuscany; they give to others what belongs to my family, which cannot be allowed in future, and Napoleon remains too near to France and Europe. The Empress Marie Louise was more loyal, but concerned above all to gain Parma as an independent sovereignty for herself: 'Parme ou rien est ma devise'. Hence her switch of loyalties from husband to father in autumn 1814. Napoleon I had hoped to link the sense of solidarity of the monarchs of Europe to the French Empire. Instead it had been turned against the Empire in the European coalition of 1813-15, From Moscow to London, consciously rivalling the monuments of the Napoleonic Empire, monarchs built triumphal arches, temples of victory and war memorials celebrating their victory over Napoleon. The picture by Peter Krafft of The Commander-in-Chief Prince Schwarzenberg presenting to Emperor Franz I, Emperor Alexander I and King Frederick William III captured French troops and standards after the Battle of Leipzig, October 18th, 1813, the Battle of the Nations which, more than Waterloo,  marked  the  end  of the  Napoleonic Empire, is the finest memorial to 'Coalition Europe'. It was painted in 1817 for the Military Invalids Hospital of Vienna as a dynastic, artistic, humanitarian and European riposte to the similar picture by Baron Gerard, once on the ceiling of the hall of the Council of State in the Tuileries: 'Count Rapp presenting the banners of the defeated Russian Imperial Guard to Napoleon I on the battlefield of Austerlitz, December 2nd, 1805'. Fewer dead and wounded are depicted; three monarchs instead of one are shown; and they are humbly dismounted rather than, like Napoleon, portrayed on horseback. After 1815 the monarchies of Europe owed relatively little, apart from a reinforced sense of Francophobia, to the Napoleonic Empire and epoch. The Napoleonic legend was a legend, not a political reality. None of Napoleon's innumerable changes to the map of Europe lasted, except for certain frontiers created for some of his German allies. All Napoleonic constitutions were abolished. Rather than continuing the military autocratic style and regime of Napoleon, many monarchs adopted liberal constitutions, based on the 1814 charter of Louis XVIII. By 1821 such constitutions had spread across half of the German Confederation; by 1848 to Spain, Piedmont and Prussia. Napoleon's most immediately important legacy was neither his guard, nor his court, nor his nobility, the majority of whom rallied to his successors, nor even perhaps the Code Napoleon, but his dynasty. After 1815, the Bonapartes continued to function as a dynasty. Indeed, because of the plebiscites of 1804 and 1815 endorsing Napoleon I, they considered themselves, as Joseph Bonaparte wrote to La Payette in 1830, more legitimate than the Bourbons. The son of Napoleon's admirer Lady Holland found in Rome in 1828 that Jerome-Napoleon, former King of Westphalia, kept 'the best mounted and most princely looking establishment' in the city, and 'will not go out where he is not received as a king'. As they had done at the Tuileries, in Rome the Bonapartes quarrelled over who had the right to a royal armchair at Madume Mere's family dinners; in the end she stopped giving them. In addition to its internal French political programme of plebiscites and strong government, the dynast)' was committed, in Europe, to reversing the two main legacies of the European coalition: the territorial settlement of 1814-15 and the Congress system. This was one reason for Louis-Napoleon's popularity and rise to power in 1848. It would be Napoleon III who, by the wars into which he led the French Empire against Russia in 1854, Austria in 1859 and Prussia in 1870, destroyed the alliance between the monarchs of Europe which had overthrown his uncle.

Scientists often call the human brain the most elaborate machine that ever existed. It contains some hundred billion neurons, and the tip of an average axon wires itself up to thousands of neighbors, producing an inordinate number of connections for analyzing data. (There are so many connections that neurons seem to obey the famed “six degrees of separation” law: no two neurons are separated by more than six steps.

To see how brain circuits work, imagine a noise—like a clack on a cobblestone—arriving at James Holman’s ear. The clack vibrates various bones and membranes inside his ear canal, and the sound wave eventually transfers its energy to a fluid in his inner ear. That fluid sloshes over rows of tiny hair cells and (depending on the sound) bends some of them to a greater or lesser extent. These hairs are connected to the dendrites of nearby nerve cells, which immediately fire and transmit electrical signals down their long axon “wires” toward the brain. Upon reaching the brain, the signal causes the axon to squirt a chemical soup into a nearby synapse. This finally arouses neurons in the auditory cortex, a patch of gray matter in the temporal lobe that analyzes the sound’s pitch, volume, and rhythm.

These axons can shuttle information around so quickly because they’re fatter than normal axons, and because they’re sheathed in a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin acts like rubber insulation on wires and prevents the signal from petering out: in whales, giraffes, and other stretched creatures, a sheathed neuron can send a signal multiple yards with little loss of fidelity. (In contrast, diseases that fray myelin, like multiple sclerosis, destroy communication between different nodes in the brain.)

one key question in neuroscience is how the clack signal “knows” which path to follow, and which neighbors to excite and which to inhibit. The answer turns out to be fairly simple: like James Holman’s cart through Siberia, brain signals follow ruts. Start with two neurons. If one neuron causes another to fire in quick succession over and over, the synapse between them actually changes in response. The axon tip of neuron one swells larger and starts packing in more bubbles of neurotransmitters to flood the synapse between them; wholly new axon branches might even sprout up.

Neuron two can then make listening to neuron one a priority by extending more dendrite receptors back toward it. This allows neuron two to respond to even low-intensity prompts. Overall, just as a wagon wheel will carve a rut into the road after repeated journeys, repeated neuron firings will carve ruts into the brain that make signals much more likely to follow some neural tracks than others.

Color-sound and color-letter synesthesia are the most common types because of brain geography: some of the regions that analyze sounds, letters, and colors lie right near each other, so signals can easily leak across the border. In theory, though, synesthesia can link any two sensations in the brain, and sixty known types exist.

Cajal spent a decade injuring the nerves and neurons of animals to test how well those tissues recovered. He found that peripheral nerves could often regenerate themselves (which explains why surgeons can reattach severed hands, feet, and penises, and get them working again). But neurons in the adult brain never grew back. This led Cajal to make the bleak declaration that “in the adult brain, nervous pathways are fixed and immutable. Everything may die, nothing may be regenerated.”

"Don't misunderstand me," I said. "Intelligence is one of the greatest human gifts. But all too often a search for knowledge drives out the search for love. This is something else I've discovered for myself very recently. I present it to you as a hypothesis: Intelligence without the ability to give and receive affection leads to mental and moral breakdown, to neurosis, and possibly even psychosis. And I say that the mind absorbed in and involved in itself as a self-centered end, to the exclusion of human relationships, can only lead to violence and pain.

I don't blame you. It's your body and your brain—and your life, even though you weren't able to make much use of it. I don't have the right to take it away from you. Nobody does.

"But I'll tell you something else, Charlie." I stood up and backed away from the mirror. "I'm not your friend. I'm your enemy. I'm not going to give up my intelligence without a struggle. I can't go back down into that cave. There's no place for me to go now, Charlie. So you've got to stay away. Stay inside my unconscious where you belong, and stop following me around. I'm not going to give up—no matter what they all think. No matter how lonely it is. I'm going to keep what they've given me and do great things for the world and for other people like you."

The blood supply provides an alternative communication channel between the brain and the body and between the body and brain. Endocrine glands throughout the body release hormones into the blood stream. These hormones inform the brain about the state of bodily functions, whilst the brain deposits hormonal instructions into its blood supply for distribution globally to the rest of the body.

The fovea is the only part of the retina specialized for high acuity vision (see Chapter 5), but it scrutinizes a very small area of our visual world. As a literal rule of thumb, foveal vision is restricted approximately to the area of your vision covered by your thumbnail held at arm’s length. It is a small window of clear vision within which you are able to decipher just 7 or 8 letters of normal print size at a time.

Light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors capture light focused as two slightly different images on the left and right retinae. The photoreceptors undertake a fundamental and remarkable transformation of energy, a transformation that must occur for all of our senses. This process is known as sensory transduction and always involves converting the energy in the sensory stimulus, in this case light energy, into an electrical signal. This is because the nervous system cannot use light or sound or touch or smell directly as a currency of information transmission. In the brain electricity is the critically important currency of information flow.

In their turn, neurotransmitters convey signals from one neuron to another by generating or suppressing electrical signals in neighbouring neurons that are specifically sensitive to particular neurotransmitters. This transformation of an electrical into a chemical signal occurs mostly at specialized sites called chemical synapses. Electrical signals can also pass directly between neurons at sites known as electrical synapses.

Brain chemistry and structure is altered by experience and the stability of these physicochemical changes presumably corresponds to the retention duration of memory. So what exactly is a memory? What kind of physical trace is left in the brain after we have learnt some new skill or fact? What is forgetting and why are some memories quickly forgotten and others never? These are questions to which I shall return later. Finally we must consider one of the most elusive of problems. While accepting that everything that the brain does depends on lawful processes occurring within and between the brain’s cells, how can we explain how ‘meanings’ arise in our minds while reading words?

Galen’s authority dominated and therefore hampered medical science and practice for some 400 years. A particularly interesting example of his influence can be seen in the early anatomical drawings of Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519). In one drawing of the head, the brain is depicted crudely consisting of three simple cavities labelled O, M, and N. Leonardo interpreted the anatomical division in functional terms in a way that would have been immediately recognizable to Galen in the 1st century.

In one important respect Descartes was breaking new ground. By comparing the workings of the brain with that of complex hydraulic machines, he was regarding the most technologically advanced artefacts of his day as templates for understanding the brain. This is a tradition that persists today; when we refer to computers and computational operations as models of how the brain acquires, processes, and stores information, for example. So while Descartes was hopelessly wrong in detail, he was adopting a modern style of reasoning.

It was therefore not surprising perhaps that cell theory, the idea that tissues are composed of cells, was thought not to apply to the brain and a radical alternative model was proposed. This came to be called the ‘reticular theory’ of brain anatomy – a surprisingly resilient interpretation that persisted well into the 20th century.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the Italian anatomist Camillo Golgi (1843–1926) developed a way of highlighting the morphology of very few neurons in any particular region of the brain. It was a staining method that fitted the bill because it allowed individual neurons to be viewed unobstructed by the tangled mass of branched processes of neighbouring cells.

the reticular theory, which held that the brain contains no discrete components, was actually obstructive to scientific progress. Progress was hindered by the concept of a machine without discrete functional components because without them it is impossible to formulate a plausible mechanism to explain how the brain might work. Scientists were sure the brain machine must have components and, given the complexity of what the brain does, lots of them. But what were they, what did they look like, and what did they do?

The neuron doctrine is rightly attributed to Ramon y Cajal who, with the help of Golgi’s new staining method, made two profound propositions. The first quite simply is that the neuron is a cell. You might think that this must have been self-evident to anyone who bothered to view a brain treated with Golgi’s method. After all, cells in the brain would be clearly visible and thus by the evidence of one’s own eyes the reticular theory must be wrong. Somewhat astonishingly, however, in spite of the images provided by his own technique, even Camillo Golgi remained a convinced reticularist.

After all, cells in the brain would be clearly visible and thus by the evidence of one’s own eyes the reticular theory must be wrong. Somewhat astonishingly, however, in spite of the images provided by his own technique, even Camillo Golgi remained a convinced reticularist.

The second of Cajal’s propositions was brilliantly insightful: neurons are structurally polarized with respect to function. For the first time, the workings of the brain were explicitly associated with the functions of physical structures at a microscopic level. Cajal concluded that a neuron’s function must be concerned with the movement and processing of information in the brain. He could only guess about the form in which information might be encoded or how it might move from place to place. In a stroke of genius, however, he postulated that it would be sensible for the components of function to impose directionality on information flow (or streaming as he called it). So he proposed that information flows in one direction, from an input region to an output region. The neuron’s cell body and its shorter processes, known as dendrites, perform input functions. Information then travels along the longest extension from the cell body, known as the axon, to the output region – the terminals of the axon and its branches that contact the input dendrites and cell body of another neuron.

Brains of the most advanced insects (honey bees) have about one million neurons, snails about 20,000, and primitive worms (nematodes) about 300. Contrast these numbers with the hundred billion or so that are required for human levels of intelligence. But the individual neurons of simple organisms operate with the very same electrical and chemical signalling machinery found in today’s most advanced brains.

discredited pseudo-science of phrenology, a theory developed by the idiosyncratic Viennese physician Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828). Gall believed that the brain is the organ of the mind but he went much further and postulated that different distinct faculties of the mind, innate attributes of personality, and intellectual ability, are located in different sites in the brain. Gall reasoned that different individuals will have these innate faculties and that the degree of their development would be reflected in the size of the surface region of the brain that housed that particular faculty.

An activated receptor causes a brief electrical response, called a synaptic potential, in the receiving neuron. These potentials may be either inhibitory or excitatory depending on whether the voltage in the receiving neuron becomes more negative (inhibitory or hyperpolarizing) or less negative (excitatory or depolarizing). Inhibitory potentials make the receiving neuron less likely to fire a nerve impulse. Excitatory potentials increase that probability. A ‘decision’ to produce nerve impulses is therefore made through the summation of all of the inhibitory and excitatory potentials impinging on a neuron. Once a critical threshold voltage is reached by this summation, nerve impulses will be generated. The more the excitation, the higher will be the frequency of the impulse train.

Nerve impulses travel rapidly along the axon, feeding information to many other neurons where the process of neurotransmitter release and chemical communication is repeated. Neurons may receive chemical signals from hundreds of other neurons through a thousand or more synapses on their surfaces, each having some influence on the ‘decision’ to fire a nerve impulse and on the firing rate.

These laws were first formulated by the British scientist Lord Kelvin (1824–1907) who figured out how to send telegraphic information across the Atlantic Ocean through a submarine cable. Lord Kelvin defined a parameter called the ‘length constant’, which allows us to compare how good different types of cable are at transmitting electrical signals over a distance. A length constant is the distance over which about two-thirds of the electrical signal’s amplitude will be lost and its value can vary enormously.

In medieval times, philosophers and theologians believed that the exchange of goods should be governed by a “just price,” determined by tradition or the intrinsic value of things. But in market societies, the economists observed, prices are set by supply and demand. There is no such thing as a “just price.”

Sowell explained; they simply reflect the value that buyers and sellers choose to place on the things they exchange.6 Jeff Jacoby, a pro-market commentator writing in the Boston Globe, argued against price-gouging laws on similar grounds: “It isn’t gouging to charge what the market will bear. It isn’t greedy or brazen. It’s how goods and services get allocated in a free society.”

If you’re fleeing a hurricane with your family, the exorbitant price you pay for gas or shelter is not really a voluntary exchange. It’s something closer to extortion. So to decide whether price-gouging laws are justified, we need to assess these competing accounts of welfare and of freedom.

A society in which people exploit their neighbors for financial gain in times of crisis is not a good society. Excessive greed is therefore a vice that a good society should discourage if it can. Price-gouging laws cannot banish greed, but they can at least restrain its most brazen expression, and signal society’s disapproval of it. By punishing greedy behavior rather than rewarding it, society affirms the civic virtue of shared sacrifice for the common good.

So the debate over the Purple Heart is more than a medical or clinical dispute about how to determine the veracity of injury. At the heart of the disagreement are rival conceptions of moral character and military valor. Those who insist that only bleeding wounds should count believe that post-traumatic stress reflects a weakness of character unworthy of honor. Those who believe that psychological wounds should qualify argue that veterans suffering long-term trauma and severe depression have sacrificed for their country as surely, and as honorably, as those who’ve lost a limb.

All they ever see is the play of shadows on the wall, a reflection of objects they can never apprehend. Only the philosopher, in this account, is able to ascend from the cave to the bright light of day, where he sees things as they really are.

These two ways of thinking about the lifeboat case illustrate two rival approaches to justice. The first approach says the morality of an action depends solely on the consequences it brings about; the right thing to do is whatever will produce the best state of affairs, all things considered. The second approach says that consequences are not all we should care about, morally speaking; certain duties and rights should command our respect, for reasons independent of the social consequences.

Its main idea is simply stated and intuitively appealing: The highest principle of morality is to maximize happiness, the overall balance of pleasure over pain. According to Bentham, the right thing to do is whatever will maximize utility. By “utility,” he means whatever produces pleasure or happiness, and whatever prevents pain or suffering.

In deciding what laws or policies to enact, a government should do whatever will maximize the happiness of the community as a whole. What, after all, is a community? According to Bentham, it is “a fictitious body,” composed of the sum of the individuals who comprise it. Citizens and legislators should therefore ask themselves this question: If we add up all of the benefits of this policy, and subtract all the costs, will it produce more happiness than the alternative?

Objection 2: A Common Currency of Value Utilitarianism claims to offer a science of morality, based on measuring, aggregating, and calculating happiness. It weighs preferences without judging them. Everyone’s preferences count equally. This nonjudgmental spirit is the source of much of its appeal. And its promise to make moral choice a science informs much contemporary economic reasoning. But in order to aggregate preferences, it is necessary to measure them on a single scale. Bentham’s idea of utility offers one such common currency.

Critics of utilitarianism point to such episodes as evidence that cost-benefit analysis is misguided, and that placing a monetary value on human life is morally obtuse.

Utilitarians see our tendency to recoil at placing a monetary value on human life as an impulse we should overcome, a taboo that obstructs clear thinking and rational social choice.

Its central principle is that people should be free to do whatever they want, provided they do no harm to others. Government may not interfere with individual liberty in order to protect a person from himself, or to impose the majority’s beliefs about how best to live. The only actions for which a person is accountable to society, Mill argues, are those that affect others. As long as I am not harming anyone else, my “independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.”

Mill thinks we should maximize utility, not case by case, but in the long run. And over time, he argues, respecting individual liberty will lead to the greatest human happiness.

First, respecting individual rights for the sake of promoting social progress leaves rights hostage to contingency. Suppose we encounter a society that achieves a kind of long-term happiness by despotic means. Wouldn’t the utilitarian have to conclude that, in such a society, individual rights are not morally required? Second, basing rights on utilitarian considerations misses the sense in which violating someone’s rights inflicts a wrong on the individual, whatever its effect on the general welfare. If the majority persecutes adherents of an unpopular faith, doesn’t it do an injustice to them, as individuals, regardless of any bad effects such intolerance may produce for society as a whole over time?

Mill’s speculations about the salutary social effects of liberty are plausible enough. But they do not provide a convincing moral basis for individual rights, for at least two reasons: First, respecting individual rights for the sake of promoting social progress leaves rights hostage to contingency. Suppose we encounter a society that achieves a kind of long-term happiness by despotic means. Wouldn’t the utilitarian have to conclude that, in such a society, individual rights are not morally required?

So actions and consequences are not all that matter after all. Character also counts. For Mill, individuality matters less for the pleasure it brings than for the character it reflects. “One whose desires and impulses are not his own, has no character, no more than a steam engine has character.”

Mill’s robust celebration of individuality is the most distinctive contribution of On Liberty. But it is also a kind of heresy.

Mill tries to save utilitarianism from this objection. Unlike Bentham, Mill believes it is possible to distinguish between higher and lower pleasures—to assess the quality, not just the quantity or intensity, of our desires. And he thinks he can make this distinction without relying on any moral ideas other than utility itself.

Despite insisting that pleasure and pain are all that matter, Mill acknowledges that “some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others.” How can we know which pleasures are qualitatively higher? Mill proposes a simple test: “Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure.”

Mill strays from the utilitarian premise. No longer are de facto desires the sole basis for judging what is noble and what is base. Now the standard derives from an ideal of human dignity independent of our wants and desires. The higher pleasures are not higher because we prefer them; we prefer them because we recognize them as higher. We judge Hamlet as great art not because we like it more than lesser entertainments, but because it engages our highest faculties and makes us more fully human.

This Robin Hood scenario is open to at least two objections—one from within utilitarian thinking, the other from outside it. The first objection worries that high tax rates, especially on income, reduce the incentive to work and invest, leading to a decline in productivity. If the economic pie shrinks, leaving less to redistribute, the overall level of utility might go down. So before taxing Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey too heavily, the utilitarian would have to ask whether doing so would lead them to work less and so to earn less, eventually reducing the amount of money available for redistribution to the needy.

The second objection regards these calculations as beside the point. It argues that taxing the rich to help the poor is unjust because it violates a fundamental right. According to this objection, taking money from Gates and Winfrey without their consent, even for a good cause, is coercive. It violates their liberty to do with their money whatever they please. Those who object to redistribution on these grounds are often called “libertarians.”

Nozick rejects patterned theories of justice in favor of those that honor the choices people make in free markets. He argues that distributive justice depends on two requirements—justice in initial holdings and justice in transfer.8 The first asks if the resources you used to make your money were legitimately yours in the first place. (If you made a fortune selling stolen goods, you would not be entitled to the proceeds.) The second asks if you made your money either through free exchanges in the marketplace or from gifts voluntarily bestowed upon you by others. If the answer to both questions is yes, you are entitled to what you have, and the state may not take it without your consent. Provided no one starts out with ill-gotten gains, any distribution that results from a free market is just, however equal or unequal it turns out to be.

First, liberty upsets patterns. Anyone who believes that economic inequality is unjust will have to intervene in the free market, repeatedly and continuously, to undo the effects of the choices people make. Second, intervening in this way—taxing Jordan to support programs that help the disadvantaged—not only overturns the results of voluntary transactions; it also violates Jordan’s rights by taking his earnings.

But these people have already been paid the market value of their services. Although they make less than Jordan, they voluntarily accepted compensation for the jobs they perform.

Objection 4: Jordan is not really being taxed without his consent. As a citizen of a democracy, he has a voice in making the tax laws to which he is subject. Libertarian reply: Democratic consent is not enough. Suppose Jordan voted against the tax law, but it passed anyway. Wouldn’t the IRS still insist that he pay? It certainly would. You might argue that by living in this society, Jordan gives his consent (at least implicitly) to abide by the majority’s will and obey the laws.

a further objection is less easy to dismiss: Objection 5: Jordan is lucky. He is fortunate to possess the talent to excel at basketball, and lucky to live in a society that prizes the ability to soar through the air and put a ball through a hoop. No matter how hard he has worked to develop his skills, Jordan cannot claim credit for his natural gifts, or for living at a time when basketball is popular and richly rewarded.

The method of hiring differs, of course.

But it remains the case that those of us who’d rather not enlist hire other people to fight our wars and risk their lives. So what’s the difference, morally speaking? If the Civil War system of hiring substitutes was unjust, isn’t the volunteer army unjust as well?

If you are a libertarian, the answer is obvious. Conscription (policy 1) is unjust because it is coercive, a form of slavery. It implies that the state owns its citizens and can do with them what it pleases, including forcing them to fight and risk their lives in war.

But even if you don’t consider conscription equivalent to slavery, you might oppose it on the grounds that it limits people’s choices, and therefore reduces overall happiness. This is a utilitarian argument against conscription. It holds that, compared to a system that permits the hiring of substitutes, conscription reduces people’s welfare by preventing mutually advantageous trades.

So, from a utilitarian point of view, the volunteer army seems the best of the three options. Letting people freely choose to enlist based on the compensation being offered enables them to serve only if doing so maximizes their own utility; and those who don’t want to serve don’t suffer the utility loss of being forced into the military against their will.

This objection says that military service is not just another job; it’s a civic obligation. According to this argument, all citizens have a duty to serve their country. Some proponents of this view believe this obligation can be discharged only through military service, while others say it can be fulfilled through other forms of national service, such as the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, or Teach for America. But if military service (or national service) is a civic duty, it’s wrong to put it up for sale on the market.

One of the most famous statements of the civic case for conscription was offered by Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), the Geneva-born Enlightenment political theorist. In The Social Contract (1762), he argues that turning a civic duty into a marketable good does not increase freedom, but rather undermines it: As soon as public service ceases to be the chief business of the citizens, and they would rather serve with their money than with their persons, the state is not far from its fall. When it is necessary to march out to war, they pay troops and stay at home. … In a country that is truly free, the citizens do everything with their own arms and nothing by means of money; so far from paying to be exempted from their duties, they would even pay for the privilege of fulfilling them themselves. I am far from taking the common view: I hold enforced labor to be less opposed to liberty than taxes.

To answer this question, we have to resolve a prior one: Is military service (and perhaps national service generally) a civic obligation that all citizens have a duty to perform, or is it a hard and risky job like others (coal mining, for example, or commercial fishing) that is properly governed by the labor market? And to answer this question, we have to ask a broader one: What obligations do citizens of a democratic society owe to one another, and how do such obligations arise?

Second, he rejected the notion that surrogacy amounts to baby-selling. The judge held that William Stern, the biological father, had not bought a baby from Mary Beth Whitehead; he’d paid her for the service of carrying his child to term. “At birth, the father does not purchase the child. It is his own biological genetically related child. He cannot purchase what is already his.”35 Since the baby was conceived with William’s sperm, it was his baby to begin with, the judge reasoned. Therefore, no baby-selling was involved.

First, the consent was flawed. Mary Beth’s agreement to bear a child and surrender it at birth was not truly voluntary, because it was not fully informed: Under the contract, the natural mother is irrevocably committed before she knows the strength of her bond with her child. She never makes a totally voluntary, informed decision, for quite clearly any decision prior to the baby’s birth is, in the most important sense, uninformed.

The argument for upholding the surrogacy contract draws on the two theories of justice we’ve considered so far—libertarianism and utilitarianism. The libertarian case for contracts is that they reflect freedom of choice; to uphold a contract between two consenting adults is to respect their liberty. The utilitarian case for contracts is that they promote the general welfare; if both parties agree to a deal, both must derive some benefit or happiness from the agreement—otherwise, they wouldn’t have made it. So, unless it can be shown that the deal reduces someone else’s utility (and by more than it benefits the parties), mutually advantageous exchanges—including surrogacy contracts—should be upheld.

Objection 1: Tainted consent The first objection, about whether Mary Beth Whitehead’s agreement was truly voluntary, raises a question about the conditions under which people make choices. It argues that we can exercise free choice only if we’re not unduly pressured (by the need for money, say), and if we’re reasonably well informed about the alternatives. Exactly what counts as undue pressure or the lack of informed consent is open to argument.

Commercial surrogacy degrades children insofar as it treats them as commodities.”44 It uses them as instruments of profit rather than cherishes them as persons worthy of love and care. Commercial surrogacy also degrades women, Anderson argues, by treating their bodies as factories and by paying them not to bond with the children they bear. It replaces “the parental norms which usually govern the practice of gestating children with the economic norms which govern ordinary production.”

Even John Locke (1632–1704), the great theorist of property rights and limited government, does not assert an unlimited right of self-possession. He rejects the notion that we may dispose of our life and liberty however we please. But Locke’s theory of unalienable rights invokes God, posing a problem for those who seek a moral basis for rights that does not rest on religious assumptions.

Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) offers an alternative account of duties and rights, one of the most powerful and influential accounts any philosopher has produced. It does not depend on the idea that we own ourselves, or on the claim that our lives and liberties are a gift from God. Instead, it depends on the idea that we are rational beings, worthy of dignity and respect.

The utilitarian’s happiness principle “contributes nothing whatever toward establishing morality, since making a man happy is quite different from making him good and making him prudent or astute in seeking his advantage quite different from making him virtuous.”2 Basing morality on interests and preferences destroys its dignity.

Kant argues that every person is worthy of respect, not because we own ourselves but because we are rational beings, capable of reason; we are also autonomous beings, capable of acting and choosing freely. Kant doesn’t mean that we always succeed in acting rationally, or in choosing autonomously. Sometimes we do and sometimes we don’t. He means only that we have the capacity for reason, and for freedom, and that this capacity is common to human beings as such.

Kant means that we respond to our senses, our feelings. So Bentham was right—but only half right. He was right to observe that we like pleasure and dislike pain. But he was wrong to insist that they are “our sovereign masters.” Kant argues that reason can be sovereign, at least some of the time. When reason governs our will, we are not driven by the desire to seek pleasure and avoid pain.

“It is concerned not with the matter of the action and its presumed results, but with its form, and with the principle from which it follows. And what is essentially good in the action consists in the mental disposition, let the consequences be what they may.” Only a categorical imperative, Kant argues, can qualify as an imperative of morality.

A false promise is not morally wrong because, writ large, it would undermine social trust (though it might well do so). It is wrong because, in making it, I privilege my needs and desires (in this case, for money) over everybody else’s.

This is the fundamental difference, Kant reminds us, between persons and things. Persons are rational beings. They don’t just have a relative value, but if anything has, they have an absolute value, an intrinsic value. That is, rational beings have dignity.

For Kant, suicide violates the categorical imperative in the same way. If I end my life to escape a painful condition, I use myself as a means for the relief of my own suffering. But as Kant reminds us, a person is not a thing, “not something to be used merely as a means.”

It also explains why the Kantian principle of respect lends itself to doctrines of universal human rights. For Kant, justice requires us to uphold the human rights of all persons, regardless of where they live or how well we know them, simply because they are human beings, capable of reason, and therefore worthy of respect.

The effort to base morality on some particular interest or desire (such as happiness or utility) was bound to fail. “For what they discovered was never duty, but only the necessity of acting from a certain interest.” But any principle based on interest “was bound to be always a conditioned one and could not possibly serve as a moral law.”

QUESTION 1: Kant’s categorical imperative tells us to treat everyone with respect, as an end in itself. Isn’t this pretty much the same as the Golden Rule? (“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”) ANSWER: No. The Golden Rule depends on contingent facts about how people would like to be treated. The categorical imperative requires that we abstract from such contingencies and respect persons as rational beings, regardless of what they might want in a particular situation.

What matters is not how you (or your mother) would feel under these circumstances, but what it means to treat persons as rational beings, worthy of respect. Here is a case where compassion might point one way and Kantian respect another. From the standpoint of the categorical imperative, lying to your mother out of concern for her feelings would arguably use her as a means to her own contentment rather than respect her as a rational being.

Insofar as we exercise pure practical reason, we abstract from our particular interests.

Freedom of the will is not the kind of thing that science can prove or disprove. Neither is morality. It’s true that human beings inhabit the realm of nature. Everything we do can be described from a physical or biological point of view. When I raise my hand to cast a vote, my action can be explained in terms of muscles, neurons, synapses, and cells. But it can also be explained in terms of ideas and beliefs. Kant says we can’t help but understand ourselves from both standpoints—the empirical realm of physics and biology, and an “intelligible” realm of free human agency.

Another way of putting this point is to say that morality is not empirical. It stands at a certain distance from the world. It passes judgment on the world. Science can’t, for all its power and insight, reach moral questions, because it operates within the sensible realm. “To argue freedom away,” Kant writes, “is as impossible for the most abstruse philosophy as it is for the most ordinary human reason.”

Paradoxically, Kant’s conception of autonomy imposes certain limits on the way we may treat ourselves. For, recall: To be autonomous is to be governed by a law I give myself—the categorical imperative. And the categorical imperative requires that I treat all persons (including myself) with respect—as an end, not merely as a means. So, for Kant, acting autonomously requires that we treat ourselves with respect, and not objectify ourselves. We can’t use our bodies any way we please.

Admittedly, helping a murderer carry out his evil deed is a pretty heavy “disadvantage.” But remember, for Kant, morality is not about consequences; it’s about principle. You can’t control the consequences of your action—in this case, telling the truth—since consequences are bound up with contingency.

Moral principles can’t be derived from empirical facts alone.

The rest of us are never required, or even asked, to give our consent. So why are we obligated to obey the law? And how can we say that our government rests on the consent of the governed? John Locke says we’ve given tacit consent. Anyone who enjoys the benefits of a government, even by traveling on the highway, implicitly consents to the law, and is bound by it.1 But tacit consent is a pale form of the real thing. It is hard to see how just passing through town is morally akin to ratifying the Constitution.

Suppose I discover, after twenty years of faithfulness on my part, that my wife has been seeing another man. I would have two different grounds for moral outrage. One invokes consent: “But we had an agreement. You made a vow. You broke your promise.” The second would invoke reciprocity: “But I’ve been so faithful for my part. Surely I deserve better than this. This is no way to repay my loyalty.” And so on. The second complaint makes no reference to consent, and does not require it.

Contracts derive their moral force from two different ideals, autonomy and reciprocity. But most actual contracts fall short of these ideals. If I’m up against someone with a superior bargaining position, my agreement may not be wholly voluntary, but pressured or, in the extreme case, coerced.

Rawls concludes that the meritocratic conception of justice is flawed for the same reason (though to a lesser degree) as the libertarian conception; both base distributive shares on factors that are morally arbitrary. “Once we are troubled by the influence of either social contingencies or natural chance on the determination of the distributive shares, we are bound, on reflection, to be bothered by the influence of the other.

Rawls’s alternative, which he calls the difference principle, corrects for the unequal distribution of talents and endowments without handicapping the talented. How? Encourage the gifted to develop and exercise their talents, but with the understanding that the rewards these talents reap in the market belong to the community as a whole. Don’t handicap the best runners; let them run and do their best. Simply acknowledge in advance that the winnings don’t belong to them alone, but should be shared with those who lack similar gifts.

four rival theories of distribution justice: Feudal or caste system: fixed hierarchy based on birth. Libertarian: free market with formal equality of opportunity. Meritocratic: free market with fair equality of opportunity. Egalitarian: Rawls’s difference principle. Rawls argues that each of the first three theories bases distributive shares on factors that are arbitrary from a moral point of view—whether accident of birth, or social and economic advantage, or natural talents and abilities. Only the difference principle avoids basing the distribution of income and wealth on these contingencies.

The successful often overlook this contingent aspect of their success. Many of us are fortunate to possess, at least in some measure, the qualities our society happens to prize. In a capitalist society, it helps to have entrepreneurial drive. In a bureaucratic society, it helps to get on easily and smoothly with superiors. In a mass democratic society, it helps to look good on television, and to speak in short, superficial sound bites.

But as Dworkin points out, there is no such right. Some universities may admit students solely on the basis of academic qualifications, but most do not. Universities define their missions in various ways. Dworkin argues that no applicant has a right that the university define its mission and design its admissions policy in a way that prizes above all any particular set of qualities—whether academic skills, athletic abilities, or anything else. Once the university defines its mission and sets its admissions standards, you have a legitimate expectation to admission insofar as you meet those standards better than other applicants. Those who finish in the top group of candidates—counting academic promise, ethnic and geographical diversity, athletic prowess, extracurricular activities, community service, and so on—are entitled to be admitted; it would be unfair to exclude them. But no one has a right to be considered according to any particular set of criteria in the first place.

Second, the idea that merit arises only once social institutions define their mission is subject to a complication: the social institutions that figure most prominently in debates about justice—schools, universities, occupations, professions, public offices—are not free to define their mission just any way they please. These institutions are defined, at least in part, by the distinctive goods they promote. While there is room for argument about what, at any moment, the mission of a law school or an army or an orchestra should be, it’s not the case that just anything goes.

Central to Aristotle’s political philosophy are two ideas, both present in the argument over Callie: Justice is teleological. Defining rights requires us to figure out the telos (the purpose, end, or essential nature) of the social practice in question. Justice is honorific. To reason about the telos of a practice—or to argue about it—is, at least in part, to reason or argue about what virtues it should honor and reward.

But the greatest influence should go to those with the qualities of character and judgment to decide if and when and how to go to war with Sparta.

The moral life aims at happiness, but by happiness Aristotle doesn’t mean what the utilitarians mean—maximizing the balance of pleasure over pain. The virtuous person is someone who takes pleasure and pain in the right things. If someone takes pleasure in watching dog fights, for example, we consider this a vice to be overcome, not a true source of happiness. Moral excellence does not consist in aggregating pleasures and pains but in aligning them, so that we delight in noble things and take pain in base ones. Happiness is not a state of mind but a way of being, “an activity of the soul in accordance with virtue.”13

Aristotle says we don’t become virtuous that way. “Moral virtue comes about as a result of habit.” It’s the kind of thing we learn by doing. “The virtues we get by first exercising them, as also happens in the case of the arts as well.”

If moral virtue is something we learn by doing, we have somehow to develop the right habits in the first place. For Aristotle, this is the primary purpose of law—to cultivate the habits that lead to good character. “Legislators make the citizens good by forming habits in them, and this is the wish of every legislator, and those who do not effect it miss their mark, and it is in this that a good constitution differs from a bad one.”

Miss Manners disagrees: “I think, to the contrary, that it is safer to hope that practicing proper behavior eventually encourages virtuous feeling; that if you write enough thank-you letters, you may actually feel a flicker of gratitude.”17 That’s how Aristotle conceives moral virtue.

For Aristotle, justice is a matter of fit. To allocate rights is to look for the telos of social institutions, and to fit persons to the roles that suit them, the roles that enable them to realize their nature. Giving persons their due means giving them the offices and honors they deserve and the social roles that accord with their nature.

Liberal theories of justice, from Kant to Rawls, worry that teleological conceptions are at odds with freedom. For them, justice is not about fit but about choice. To allocate rights is not to fit people to roles that suit their nature; it is to let people choose their roles for themselves.

Slavery is necessary, Aristotle argues, because someone must look after the household chores if citizens are to spend time in the assembly deliberating about the common good. The polis requires a division of labor. Unless we invent machines that could take care of all menial tasks, some people have to attend to the necessities of life so that others can be free to participate in politics.

How can you tell who is fit to be a slave? Aristotle asks. In principle, you would have to see who, if anyone, flourishes as a slave, and who chafes in the role or tries to flee. The need for force is a good indication that the slave in question is not suited to the role.31 For Aristotle, coercion is a sign of injustice, not because consent legitimates all roles, but because the need for force suggests an unnatural fit. Those who are cast in a role consistent with their nature don’t need to be forced.

For Aristotle, even consent against fair background conditions is not sufficient; for the work to be just, it has to be suited to the nature of the workers who perform it. Some jobs fail this test. They are so dangerous, repetitive, and deadening as to be unfit for human beings. In those cases, justice requires that the work be reorganized to accord with our nature. Otherwise, the job is unjust in the same way that slavery is.

The doctrine of moral individualism does not assume that people are selfish. It is rather a claim about what it means to be free. For the moral individualist, to be free is to be subject only to obligations I voluntarily incur; whatever I owe others, I owe by virtue of some act of consent—a choice or a promise or an agreement I have made, be it tacit or explicit.

An early version of the choosing self comes to us from John Locke. He argued that legitimate government must be based on consent. Why? Because we are free and independent beings, not subject to paternal authority or the divine right of kings. Since we are “by nature, all free, equal and independent, no one can be put out of this estate, and subjected to the political power of another, without his own consent.”

myself. For MacIntyre (as for Aristotle), the narrative, or teleological, aspect of moral reflection is bound up with membership and belonging. We all approach our own circumstances as bearers of a particular social identity. I am someone’s son or daughter, someone’s cousin or uncle; I am a citizen of this or that city, a member of this or that guild or profession; I belong to this clan, that tribe, this nation. Hence what is good for me has to be the good for one who inhabits these roles. As such, I inherit from the past of my family, my city, my tribe, my nation, a variety of debts, inheritances, rightful expectations and obligations. These constitute the given of my life, my moral starting point. This is in part what gives my own life its moral particularity.

Unlike natural duties, obligations of solidarity are particular, not universal; they involve moral responsibilities we owe, not to rational beings as such, but to those with whom we share a certain history. But unlike voluntary obligations, they do not depend on an act of consent.

One of the reasons Kant and Rawls reject Aristotle’s way of thinking about justice is that they don’t think it leaves room for freedom. A constitution that tries to cultivate good character or to affirm a particular conception of the good life risks imposing on some the values of others. It fails to respect persons as free and independent selves, capable of choosing their ends for themselves.

But the case for same-sex marriage can’t be made on nonjudgmental grounds. It depends on a certain conception of the telos of marriage—its purpose or point. And, as Aristotle reminds us, to argue about the purpose of a social institution is to argue about the virtues it honors and rewards.

Many opponents of same-sex marriage claim that the primary purpose of marriage is procreation. According to this argument, since same-sex couples are unable to procreate on their own, they don’t have a right to marry. They lack, so to speak, the relevant virtue. This teleological line of reasoning is at the heart of the case against same-sex marriage, and Marshall takes it on directly. She does not pretend to be neutral on the purpose of marriage, but offers a rival interpretation of it. The essence of marriage, she maintains, is not procreation but an exclusive, loving commitment between two partners—be they straight or gay.

She does so by showing that marriage, as currently practiced and regulated by the state, does not require the ability to procreate. Heterosexual couples who apply for marriage licenses are not asked about “their ability or intention to conceive children by coitus. Fertility is not a condition of marriage, nor is it grounds for divorce. People who have never consummated their marriage, and never plan to, may be and stay married.

Over the course of this journey, we’ve explored three approaches to justice. One says justice means maximizing utility or welfare—the greatest happiness for the greatest number. The second says justice means respecting freedom of choice—either the actual choices people make in a free market (the libertarian view) or the hypothetical choices people would make in an original position of equality (the liberal egalitarian view). The third says justice involves cultivating virtue and reasoning about the common good.

The utilitarian approach has two defects: First, it makes justice and rights a matter of calculation, not principle. Second, by trying to translate all human goods into a single, uniform measure of value, it flattens them, and takes no account of the qualitative differences among them.

Justice is inescapably judgmental. Whether we’re arguing about financial bailouts or Purple Hearts, surrogate motherhood or same-sex marriage, affirmative action or military service, CEO pay or the right to use a golf cart, questions of justice are bound up with competing notions of honor and virtue, pride and recognition. Justice is not only about the right way to distribute things. It is also about the right way to value things.

In earlier chapters, we consider the moral questions that arise, for example, when countries hire out military service and the interrogation of prisoners to mercenaries or private contractors; or when parents outsource pregnancy and child-bearing to paid laborers in the developing world; or when people buy and sell kidneys on the open market. Other instances abound: Should students in underperforming schools be offered cash payments for scoring well on standardized tests? Should teachers be given bonuses for improving the test results of their students? Should states hire for-profit prison companies to house their inmates? Should the United States simplify its immigration policy by adopting the proposal of a University of Chicago economist to sell U.S. citizenship for a $100,000 fee?

This has two bad effects, one fiscal, the other civic. First, public services deteriorate, as those who no longer use those services become less willing to support them with their taxes. Second, public institutions such as schools, parks, playgrounds, and community centers cease to be places where citizens from different walks of life encounter one another. Institutions that once gathered people together and served as informal schools of civic virtue become few and far between. The hollowing out of the public realm makes it difficult to cultivate the solidarity and sense of community on which democratic citizenship depends.

Rather than avoid the moral and religious convictions that our fellow citizens bring to public life, we should attend to them more directly—sometimes by challenging and contesting them, sometimes by listening to and learning from them. There is no guarantee that public deliberation about hard moral questions will lead in any given situation to agreement—or even to appreciation for the moral and religious views of others. It’s always possible that learning more about a moral or religious doctrine will lead us to like it less. But we cannot know until we try.

For a submarine cable, the length constant is a small fraction of the distance over which information must be sent and the same is true for biological cables, axons. So in a similarly salty environment both submarine cables and axons must detect a failing electrical signal and boost it back to its original strength before sending it on its way again.

The pumping creates an imbalance between the inside and outside concentrations of the two ions. Sodium ions are maintained at about tenfold higher concentration outside than inside the neuron and approximately the reverse situation exists for potassium. These concentration gradients, in the absence of barriers, would result in sodium entering and potassium leaving the neuron.

Biological cables are inherently slow conductors of signals because the nerve impulse depends on the movement of ions across a membrane rather than the displacement of electrons along a wire. Higher transmission speed can be achieved by improving the insulation of the axon membrane and by increasing the electrical conductivity of the axon’s core.

So to obtain significant gains in speed we would have to produce axons of gigantic girth. A related drawback is that a brain would contain fast components, but inevitably there would be fewer of them. Evolving high performance brains depended in part on the miniaturization of the brain’s components and on getting as many fast neurons as possible packed into a small volume. For this, evolutionary selection pressure did not favour giant neurons.

At a typical chemical synapse a narrow gap or cleft between two communicating neurons makes the direct exchange of electrical or chemical signals impossible. For information to be transmitted across the gap the electrical activity of a neuron must cause the release of a chemical message that diffuses across the synaptic cleft to the receiving neuron. The synaptic machinery allowing electrical activity in the signalling neuron to be coupled to the release of neurotransmitter is highly complex and specialized, as are the mechanisms that capture the chemical message and initiate responses in the receiving neuron.

Much of the brain’s structural complexity arises because its evolution has been less of an ‘out with the old, in with the new’ process, and more a case of ‘on with the old, in with the new’. This has resulted in new structures being layered upon more primitive ones, which may retain their original functions albeit in the context of the new opportunities provided by the newly acquired ones.

The three divisions of the brain can be thought of as a hierarchy in which the forebrain controls the midbrain, which controls the hindbrain. The brainstem (mid- and hindbrain) is concerned with essential but non-cognitive bodily functions such as breathing, the regulation of blood flow, and the coordination of locomotion. Basic processing of sensory information is also performed by the midbrain structures, but more complex processing occurs when this partly processed information is distributed up the hierarchy to the forebrain. The forebrain can be regarded as the executive centre, which considers sensory information of all kinds and formulates commands, decisions, and judgements based on the sensory information and on experience.

Although there is no watertight explanation for the runaway pace of evolutionary change that human brain development would seem to require, one of the more imaginative ideas is that our frontal brain is an ornament required for courtship display. According to this idea, the human brain is the product of the mutual preference of men and women for mating with partners who display unusually creative intelligence in the rituals of courtship. This can result in a form of natural selection called sexual selection. It depends on creativity in courtship and the large brain that it requires being heritable traits.

Although we generally refer only to the five traditional senses – sight, touch, audition, taste, and smell – there are in fact many more. Other sensations include those of heat and cold, gravitation, acceleration, pain, etc.

Sensations however are just one contributory component to perception. It is possible to perceive what is not sensed, not to perceive what is sensed, and to construct more than one perception from the same sensations.

Perceptions are the brain’s educated guesses about what the combined senses are telling it, and as such they will almost always depend on interactions between different modalities.

the gods of Asgard came from Germany, spread into Scandinavia, and then out into the parts of the world dominated by the Vikings—into Orkney and Scotland, Ireland and the north of England—where the invaders left places named for Thor or Odin. In English, the gods have left their names in our days of the week. You can find Tyr the one-handed (Odin’s son), Odin, Thor, and Frigg, the queen of the gods, in, respectively, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Nehru: Death of a Democrat On December 17th and 18th, 1961, on Nehru’s orders, Indian troops marched into Goa, an area of about 1,500 square miles on the country’s western coast, to ‘liberate’ it from the Portuguese, who had ruled the territory since 1510. In a brisk operation over 30,000 Indian troops overran this last colonial enclave, overwhelming and capturing about 3,500 Portuguese soldiers. Condemnation was swift, both from critics at home and abroad. C. Rajagopalachari, one of the country’s most respected elder statesmen, said that India had ‘totally lost the moral power to raise her voice against militarism’. Others pointed out that the military adventure in Goa was a ploy to divert the nation’s attention from the increasing Chinese border incursions (since 1959 the Chinese had occupied over 12,000 square miles of formerly Indian territory). Further afield, the action was ‘deeply deplored’ by Britain, the US, Canada, Australia, Pakistan, New Zealand, West Germany and other countries. Nehru was denounced as a hypocrite who preached non-violence and disarmament to the world, yet practised the use of force at home. A UN Security Council resolution against India was almost voted in favour, but for a veto by the Soviet Union. Just a few weeks earlier, on November 14th, 1961, Nehru had celebrated his 72nd birthday with customary fervour. ‘A miracle of health’ in the words of someone who worked closely with him, Nehru practised yoga regularly, including the headstand. He typically worked a 16-hour day, seven days a week and received about 500 letters and 100 telegrams a day. He travelled widely and wrote and delivered around 25 speeches a month. Then in his 15th year as premier, he held several positions, including Cabinet portfolios of external affairs and atomic energy and chairmanship of the planning commission, exercising unrivalled political authority. In the election campaign that took place immediately after the invasion Nehru was able to strike a patriotic chord, capitalising on ‘restoring Goa to the Motherland’. His ruling Congress party was re-elected in 361 out of 494 parliamentary seats and was back in power for a third successive term. Yet, in spite of the criticism, no one could foresee that the triumphant note sounded over Goa also marked the countdown to the end of Nehru’s leadership. The military conflict with China that broke out in full force in October 1962 would be momentous for India, bringing about extraordinary tribulations for Nehru. In its aftermath came growing tensions with Pakistan, political unrest in the Kashmir valley and domestic criticism and challenges to his political authority. In November 1961, just before the Goa campaign, in response to stinging criticism in parliament, Nehru and his defence minister, V.K. Krishna Menon, had taken steps to reclaim from the Chinese some territory by setting up forward posts. Arguably, this much debated ‘forward policy’ inflamed the situation. In August 1962 Nehru informed parliament that Indian soldiers had re-occupied around 4,000 sq km of some 19,000 sq km of territory that the Chinese had taken. The prospect of war loomed. Later the cabinet secretary, S.S. Khera, recalled: ‘Suspicion, distrust, a mood of general sullenness, seemed to lie like an incubus upon everything and haunted everyone in the defence ministry from Krishna Menon downwards during the critical period before the crisis of 1962.’ *** In the spring of 1962 Nehru suffered his first serious illness, due to a kidney affliction known as pyelonephritis. He recovered quickly but his body acquired a slight stoop and he was forced by doctors to cut down his long working days. In September he attended the Commonwealth prime ministers’ conference in London, even as he knew that border tensions with China were getting out of hand. Yet, when the Chinese strike came on October 19th and 20th, the Indian leadership called it an unprovoked and sudden offensive, a ‘Himalayan Pearl Harbor’. While the Chinese advance was swift and dramatic, beginning with the assault on Namka Chu in Ladakh and the occupation of Tawang in the north-east, the Indian response revealed an utter lack of planning and a failure of leadership. As the Chinese overran the Himalayan frontier, precipitating a full-scale confrontation, the Indian army suffered a virtual rout in both Ladakh and the north-east sectors. In the course of the conflict the Indian casualty figure reached  7,000, with nearly 1,400 dead. A month later, on November 21st, a unilateral ceasefire was called by the Chinese; by then they had wrestled over 23,200 sq km of territory from India, retaining 4,000 sq km in the Ladakh region. Indian counter-defence was catastro-phic. Over 3,000 ill-equipped, ill-rationed and unacclimatised soldiers were mobilised, with only about 400 of them issued with adequate winter clothing. Gurkha and Rajput units had been made to march in biting cold to Namka Chu in Ladakh with just cotton uniforms, canvas shoes and one blanket per man. Unaccustomed to the altitude and the terrain, the Indians faced over 10,000 well-provisioned Chinese soldiers. Raj Thapar, a member of the army chief Lieutenant General P.M. Thapar’s household, later recalled: ‘The picture in my mind ... was of an ill-equipped army, of generals running around barefoot, trying to sort out matters but not succeeding, a sort of bedlam.’ Reports circulated about deep divisions within the military top brass. General Thapar had advocated caution, but was overruled by Menon, whose protégé, Lieutenant General B.M. Kaul, was made corps commander. Within days of the crisis Kaul, unable to withstand the high-altitude battlefront, was stricken with pleurisy and evacuated to his sickbed in Delhi, from where he continued to direct military operations. War led to a declaration of national emergency. Images of poorly armed and ill-shod Indian soldiers fighting desperately across the snow-capped frontier captured the popular imagination. The nation enveloped itself in patriotic sentimentalism. Citizens’ rallies and defence fund collection drives were organised across the country. In the spirit of national unity, criticism was initially muted, but the conduct of the Indian operation badly damaged Nehru’s standing. The perception was widespread that the government had bungled badly. Even President Radhakrishnan, after a visit to the front, publicly acknowledged the government’s ‘credulity and negligence’. As the blame game began, heads started to roll. The army chief and the chief of staff were both fired. Although Nehru maintained a stoic silence, he could not continue to ignore demands for Menon’s resignation. On October 31st he responded with ‘a half-measure’ by taking charge of defence himself, but allowed Menon to continue in the cabinet as minister for defence production. Menon did not help matters by declaring: ‘Nothing is changed. I’m still a member of cabinet and I am still sitting in the defence ministry.’ While Menon took most of the blame for the appalling state of the nation’s defences and his idiosyncratic handling of the generals, critics attributed India’s defeat to Nehru’s altruistic external policy of non-alignment and his failure to take a realistic stance towards China. Congress party stalwarts closed ranks to force the prime minister’s hand. They told Nehru bluntly: ‘It is Menon today. Tomorrow will be your turn.’ *** The Himalayan war was a dramatic turning point for Nehru’s leadership. The premier made a desperate plea for military help to the US president John F. Kennedy and the British prime minister Harold Macmillan. He also approached the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to use his influence to restrain the Chinese. Throughout much of the war the two great powers, the US and the Soviet Union, were caught up in a deadly game of brinksmanship over the Cuban Missile Crisis. The American envoy in New Delhi, J.K. Galbraith, however, managed to persuade the Kennedy administration to dispatch help. By the first week of November over 60 plane loads of ammunition had been flown to India. The British response was more circumspect. However, by late November high-powered US and British delegations were in New Delhi, led by US Under Secretary of State Averell Harriman and British Commonwealth Secretary Duncan Sandys. The Chinese ceasefire on November 21st came as a relief, but the greater challenge of defending the long Himalayan frontier remained. Although India and the Soviet Union had signed a deal in August 1962 for MiG-21 fighter planes, these never materialised during the hostilities, leading to speculation that the Soviets would not permit the use of their weapons against another Communist country. A peace conference of African and Asian leaders in Colombo, convened by the Ceylonese premier Sirimavo Bandaranaike, only revealed division among the non-aligned nations and failed to produce tangible results. Nehru was upset that US and British offers of military help came with strings attached. India was now forced to accept outside mediation and to open a dialogue with Pakistan over the highly contentious issue of Kashmir. Both the US and UK governments had used the Himalayan crisis to put pressure on India to make concessions to Pakistan and to settle the Kashmir issue. Nehru’s carefully nurtured policy of non-alignment suffered a setback and India’s stature on the global stage, which he had worked so hard to build, diminished. *** In April 1963 the Congress party lost three critical parliamentary by-elections. The political undercurrents now came out into the open. Some of Nehru’s most trenchant critics from across the opposition – the elder politician J.B. Kripalani, the socialist firebrand Ram Manohar Lohia and the suave right-wing Swatantra party leader Minoo Masani – returned to parliament ‘to pour scorn on an ageing and disillusioned prime minister’. In parliament’s monsoon session Kripalani moved a motion of no confidence, the first such challenge to his leadership Nehru had faced since 1947. Although defeated, the motion was deeply symbolic of the shifting political dissatisfaction with the government. Anxious stirrings within the Congress party reflected the mood. Over 80 members of its national committee petitioned for a special session to discuss the slide in the party’s political fortunes. Held on August 9th and 10th, 1963, the special Congress began innocuously with the party delegates deliberating ways to revive the organisation. Behind the scenes, though, a far-reaching purge was being conceived by the party chiefs to refurbish its image and to reinforce Nehru’s standing. The session triggered a political earthquake, the largest reshuffle, both in government and party, in India’s political history. Known as the ‘Kamaraj Plan’ after its author K. Kamaraj Nadar, the influential chief minister of Madras, it called upon Congress leaders holding ministerial office at the centre and in the states to relinquish their positions and devote themselves to organisational work to revive and strengthen the party. A game of musical chairs was played out over who would stay in office and who would be forced to quit. Nehru, working closely with Kamaraj, pondered the political chess board. Finally, after two weeks of suspense, over half of the central Cabinet and the chief ministers of six states were made to take the ‘path of renunciation’. Those eliminated from cabinet posts included the Bombay MP S.K. Patil and Morarji Desai, whose personality and ideology Nehru found distasteful. He was also able to get rid of Bakshi Gulam Mohammad, the controversial chief minister of Kashmir. It appeared that Nehru, the consummate politician, had succeeded in regaining his authority over party and government. However, the Congress party heavyweights realised that they had to face up to the inevitable question: ‘After Nehru Who?’ The party had to  survive, take care of its electoral interests and move on in uncertain times. Some of these men, including Kamaraj, met quietly in October 1963 in the temple town of Tirupati in southern India to form what came to be known as the ‘Syndicate’, an informal leadership collective to manage the question of political succession. The outbreak of war with China brought another hopelessly tangled issue to Nehru’s urgent attention, that of Kashmir. During the 1962 war Pakistan’s president, Ayub Khan, had protested vehemently against US and British military aid to India, declaring that it ‘may enlarge and prolong the conflict’ and warning that the arms might be used against Pakistan over the Kashmir dispute. To assuage Pakistani fears, Averell Harriman and Duncan Sandys travelled to Rawalpindi soon after visiting New Delhi. The outcome of their visit was a joint statement by Nehru and Ayub Khan issued on November 29th, 1962 agreeing to renew efforts to resolve the Kashmir dispute. Nehru’s hands were tied due to the circumstances but in private he strongly resented this interference in what he considered was a bilateral dispute. Talks began between the Indian minister Swaran Singh and the Pakistani foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. However, in January 1963, even as discussions were underway, Pakistan announced a provisional agreement under which it ceded over 10,000 sq kms of territory in Pakistani-occupied Kashmir to China – territory over which India made claims. New Delhi saw this gesture as adding insult to injury. Held over six prolonged rounds between December 1962 and May 1963, the talks proved unproductive and only hardened attitudes on both sides. American and British diplomatic efforts now turned to getting Nehru and Ayub Khan to accept third party international mediation to solve the Kashmir deadlock, a proposal that went against the grain of Nehru’s creed of non-alignment. *** Meanwhile, in Kashmir – from where Nehru’s ancestors came and a region with which he identified strongly – the political crisis deepened. Resentment against the unpopular regime of Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, who had replaced the charismatic Sheikh Abdullah as chief minister, was rife, even though Bakshi had resigned under the Kamaraj Plan and one of his cronies had succeeded him. People regarded the detention of Abdullah, imprisoned for 11 years without trial, as being part of a political vendetta. To aggravate the situation, on December 26th, 1963 a crisis arose due to the mysterious theft of a relic of the Prophet Muhammad from the shrine of Hazratbal in Srinagar. The relic, a three-inch strand of the Prophet’s hair kept in a silver-capped glass phial, had been brought to Srinagar by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the 17th century. Violent disorder broke out as thousands of Kashmiri Muslims took to the streets to express their distress and Nehru had to make a radio broadcast to calm the situation. Although the relic was returned surreptitiously to the shrine on January 2nd, 1964, rumours circulated that it was not authentic and popular protests continued for several weeks. Mass demonstrations also occurred across cities in Pakistan at Karachi, Rawalpindi, Dhaka and Lahore against this ‘Indian conspiracy’. On January 30th Nehru sent Lal Bahadur Shastri, his trusted Congress party lieutenant and political troubleshooter, to Srinagar to deal with the crisis. Shastri ordered that Islamic clerics examine the relic. On February 2nd, in scenes of high drama, the clerics pronounced it to be genuine. A public exhibition followed and anger thereafter subsided. Nonetheless the Hazratbal incident had far-reaching consequences. Sectarian violence broke out in the Khulna and Jessore districts of East Pakistan. Thousands of displaced Hindu families fleeing the rioting took refuge in the Indian State of West Bengal. In retaliation, violence against Muslim minorities was reported from the Indian cities of Calcutta, Jamshedpur and Rourkela. Nehru dreaded the vicious cycle of Hindu-Muslim violence, with its inevitable displacement of people from their homes. He had lived through the horrors of Partition. To his distress it had begun once again. Although he was now seriously unwell, Nehru knew that a turnaround was needed in Kashmir. In April 1964 Sheikh Abdullah was released from prison. After a ten-day triumphant procession across the Kashmir valley, Abdullah addressed an ecstatic crowd of over 250,000 people at a rally in Srinagar, where he strongly reaffirmed the right of Kashmiri people to self-determination. He then visited New Delhi, staying as Nehru’s guest in his house. It appeared that a major initiative was underway to find a lasting solution to the Kashmir problem centred around Abdullah. The Kashmiri leader held wide-ranging talks with Nehru and several important figures. He also received an invitation from Ayub Khan to visit Pakistan, which Nehru encouraged him to accept. Through these turbulent months, Nehru kept his nerve. Even in the gloomiest moments of the war he did not seek scapegoats. Neither did he conceal his grief for the loss of Indian soldiers. In January 1963 he is said to have been moved to tears before more than 50,000 people when the singer Lata Mangeshkar performed the patriotic Hindi elegy ‘Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon!’ (Oh The People of My Country!). During this time he continued to seek the counsel of President Radhakrishnan and of close Cabinet colleagues such as Shastri, T.T. Krishnamachari and Y.B. Chavan, who took over the defence portfolio from Menon. *** On January 7th, 1964 Nehru suffered a mild stroke at Bhubaneswar in eastern India, where he had gone to attend the annual session of the Congress party. He recovered after a few days and returned to the capital but his left limbs were affected. Recalling those days Harivanshrai Bachchan, Hindi poet and a friend of Nehru’s daughter, Indira Gandhi, wrote: ‘When Induji [Indira] brought Panditji [Nehru] home from Bhubaneshwar, I went to visit him early one morning, and found her walking with him hand-in-hand in the Teen Murti garden. The paralysis had affected the left side of Panditji’s body; the lawn was still wet with dew, and while Panditji’s right footprints were distinct and separate, a long continuous trail in the damp grass indicated the dragging of his left foot. It was a most pathetic sight.’ Arrangements were now made to lighten Nehru’s responsibilities. Lal Bahadur Shastri was appointed to the Cabinet as minister without portfolio. Shastri was to ‘look after’ Nehru’s work relating to foreign affairs, planning and atomic energy, besides handling all important matters requiring the prime minister’s attention. Nehru soon recovered and from March onwards resumed attending parliament. In May he travelled to the India-Nepal border to meet the king of Nepal and then to Bombay for a Congress party meeting. At the same time Abdullah arrived in Rawalpindi, where he met Pakistani leaders. On the morning of May 27th after returning in apparently good health from a few days’ holiday at Dehra Dun, Nehru suffered a sudden heart attack. He died later that afternoon. The following day his funeral procession started from Teen Murti House, as an estimated three million people lined the route. Nehru was cremated on the bank of the River Jamuna, about 300 yards from where Gandhi’s funeral pyre had been in 1948. Those present included the British prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the US Secretary of State Dean Rusk and the Soviet vice-premier Alexei Kosygin. Among the mourners was a tearful Sheikh Abdullah, who, on learning of Nehru’s death, had cancelled his tour of the Pakistani-held ‘Azad Kashmir’ and rushed back to Delhi. Twelve days of national mourning were observed, culminating in the immersion of a portion of Nehru’s ashes at the confluence of the holy rivers, the Yamuna and the Ganges, at Allahabad, his birthplace. In a will made in 1954 Nehru had requested that the ‘major portion of my ashes … be carried high up into the air in an aeroplane and scattered from that height over the fields where the peasants of India toil, so that they might mingle with the dust and soil of India and become an indistinguishable part of India’.  Deeply respectful of the norms and processes of a young democracy, Nehru always believed that the question of succession should be decided by the party and the people after he was gone. The political transition that followed his death was remarkably smooth. With the support of the Syndicate, Lal Bahadur Shastri was unanimously elected Nehru’s successor. In his inaugural address Shastri emphasised continuity: ‘There comes a time in the life of every nation when it stands at the crossroads of history and must choose which way to go. But for us there need be no difficulty or hesitation, no looking to right or left. Our way is straight and clear – the building up of a socialist democracy at home with freedom and prosperity for all … and friendship with all nations.’ However Shastri also inherited many of the challenges of the Nehru era, including building up defence capabilities, political unrest in Kashmir and worsening relations with Pakistan, which erupted in full-scale war in September 1965. Shastri’s unexpected death in January 1966 brought about yet another political succession. This propelled to the fore Nehru’s daughter Indira Gandhi – the beginning of a political dynasty, of which Nehru would have strongly disapproved for a democratic country such as India.

DNA passes on information with extraordinary fidelity. It makes only about one error per every billion letters copied. Still, because your cells divide so much, that is about three errors, or mutations, per cell division. Most of those mutations the body can ignore, but just occasionally they have lasting significance. That is evolution.

And it is surely astounding to reflect that not once in the three billion years since life began has your personal line of descent been broken. For you to be here now, every one of your ancestors had to successfully pass on its genetic material to a new generation before being snuffed out or otherwise sidetracked from the procreative process.

My DNA and your DNA will differ in three to four million places, which is a small proportion of the total but enough to make a lot of difference between us.

The flush we get when angry is a little counterintuitive. When the body is poised for a fight, it mostly diverts blood flow to where it is really needed—namely, the muscles—so why it would send blood to the face, where it confers no obvious physiological benefit, remains a mystery. One possibility suggested by Jablonski is that it helps in some way to mediate blood pressure. Or it could just serve as a signal to an opponent to back off because one is really angry.

Skin comes in two varieties: with hair and without. Hairless skin is called glabrous, and there isn’t much of it. Our only truly hairless parts are lips, nipples and genitalia, and the bottoms of our hands and feet. The rest of the body is covered with either conspicuous hair, called terminal hair, as on your head, or vellus hair, which is the downy stuff you find on a child’s cheek. We are actually as hairy as our cousins the apes. It’s just that our hair is much wispier and fainter. Altogether we are estimated to have five million hairs, but the number varies with age and circumstances, and is only a guess anyway.

Sweat glands come in two varieties: eccrine and apocrine. Eccrine glands are much the more numerous and produce the watery sweat that dampens your shirt on a sweltering day. Apocrine glands are confined mostly to the groin and armpits (technically the axilla) and produce a thicker, stickier sweat.

But bacteria can swap genes among themselves, as if they were Pokémon cards, and they can pick up DNA from dead neighbors. These horizontal gene transfers, as they are known, massively accelerate their capacity to adapt to whatever nature and science throw at them. The DNA of bacteria is less scrupulous in its proofreading, too, so they mutate more often, giving them even greater genetic nimbleness.

• The compound or kenning: This is a kind of metaphor, common in Old English poetry, in which two words are combined to form a third word that may make little or no reference to the two original elements. According to author Simon Winchester’s study of the OED, there are “50 words in Old English that signify the sea,” including such combinations as whale-way, drowning-flood, and waters-strife. Modern compounds include firearm, highball, and outgoing. Examples of classic slang are listed in The Little Hiptionary: the bee’s knees, the cat’s pajamas, fix his wagon, fly by the seat of your pants, heavens to betsy, peace out, spend a penny (go to the bathroom in the days of pay toilets), spill the beans. Just remember that the outgoing mail may be delivered by an outgoing male.

English has a history, of course, and one of its pivotal moments came in AD 1066 when the Normans conquered England and brought with them from France their language and culture. As a result, we often have two words for the same thing: a short word from an Anglo-Saxon root, and a longer word from a French and Latin root: as in lively and vivacious.

Consider this paragraph from James Wood, author of How Fiction Works: In this book I try to ask some of the essential questions about the art of fiction. Is realism real? How do we define a successful metaphor? What is a character? When do we recognize a brilliant use of detail in fiction? What is point of view, and how does it work? What is imaginative sympathy? Why does fiction move us? These are old questions, some of which have been resuscitated by recent work in academic criticism and literary theory; but I am not sure that academic criticism and literary theory have answered them very well. I hope, then, that this book might be one which asks theoretical questions but answers them practically—or to say it differently, asks a critic’s questions and offers a writer’s answers. That is a nifty paragraph, one I wish I had written myself. It has the basic structure required of classic paragraphs: a sharply drawn topic sentence at the start; by my count, eight examples of questions; a complicating turn in the middle (about the inadequacy of criticism and theory); and a resounding conclusion that gives me confidence that this author knows what he’s talking about.

The most efficient method of transfer for germs, it seems, is a combination of folding money and nasal mucus. A study in Switzerland in 2008 found that flu virus can survive on paper money for two and a half weeks if it is accompanied by a microdot of snot. Without snot, most cold viruses could survive on folding money for no more than a few hours.

Another useful grammar tool is the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs. The word transitive derives from the Latin and means “to go across” or “to pass over.” Thus, a transitive verb is one in which the meaning passes over from the verb to a direct object. Verbs such as hit and pummel almost always take an object.

A left-branching sentence works, by definition, in the opposite direction. Subordinate elements pile up on the front end, with the main meaning arriving—at times in dramatic form—near the end, as in my prose summary of the first lines of Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales: When April comes with its sweet showers and pierces the dry days of March and soaks every root with such sweet liqueur that flowers jump up; when the sweet west wind has breathed upon the tender shoots in every wood and field, and the young sun has run its course halfway across the sign of the Ram, and small birds sing and sleep all night with eyes wide open—as Nature excites their little hearts—that’s when English folks bust out to go on pilgrimages. When this happens, when that happens, when the other thing happens, then off we go to Canterbury.

So that sounds to me like a kind of language tool: If you write a narrative in the present tense and want to create some suspense, step away from the story line and address the reader in the past tense. It’s also possible to shift from the historical past to the present to make a particular scene stand out from the rest. But you must do this with a purpose and a plan.

Letters represent sounds. Words are built from letters. A group of words makes a phrase. Add a subject and verb, and you have a clause. If that clause expresses a complete thought, we call it a sentence. But if that clause expresses an incomplete thought, it is called subordinate or dependent, and we have to attach it to a main clause or it will not be considered Standard English. One complete sentence, or even a fragment or a word, can serve as a paragraph. More often, though, several sentences join together in a paragraph to develop a thesis or idea. And several paragraphs, sometimes many, are required to write an essay, report, or chapter for a book. What an amazing process.

The verbless sentence is a device for enlivening the written word by approximating it to the spoken. There is nothing new about it. Tacitus, for one, was much given to it. What is new is its vogue with English journalists and other writers, and it may be worth while to attempt some analysis of the purposes it is intended to serve. Among those purposes, Gowers lists (with examples): a transition, an afterthought, a dramatic climax, a sharp comment, a picture, an aggressive opinion—in general, the creation of a livelier, more staccato style.

The intentional fragment or verbless sentence can work for you and the reader, but only if you use it as a purposeful strategy.

If the complex sentence conveys unequal ideas, then we need a sentence structure to communicate equal ones, and that structure is called compound: “You will provide the information, or I will kill your entire family.” That bit of dialogue from a thousand different action movies works because of the balance imposed by the sentence structure: do this, or I will do that.

• The punctuation of a complex sentence depends on the position of the subordinate clause. That advice seems abstract, but the application is quite easy. If the weaker clause comes first, use a comma to separate it from the main clause. (As I just did.) You will usually not need a comma if the weaker clause comes at the end of the sentence.

As soon as you use associative language, you begin using figures of speech. If you say this talk is dry and dull, you’re using figures associating it with bread and breadknives. There are two main kinds of association, analogy and identity, two things that are like each other and two things that are each other. You can say with Burns, “My love’s like a red, red rose,” or you can say with Shakespeare: Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament And only herald to the gaudy spring. One produces the figure of speech called the simile; the other produces the figure called metaphor.

To understand the difference between a good adverb and a bad adverb, consider these two sentences: “She smiled happily” and “She smiled sadly.” Which one works best? The first seems weak because “smiled” contains the meaning of “happily.” On the other hand, “sadly” changes the meaning.

Look also for weak verb-adverb combinations that you can revise with stronger verbs: “She went quickly down the stairs” can become “She dashed down the stairs.” “He listened surreptitiously” can become “He eavesdropped.” Give yourself a choice.

To put it another way, why is “Wish and hope and think and pray” stronger than “Wishin’ and hopin’ and thinkin’ and prayin’”? With apologies to Dusty Springfield, the answer resides in the history of English as an inflected language.

An inflection is an element we add to a word to change its meaning. For example, we add -s or -es to a noun to indicate the plural. Add -s or -ed to a verb, and we distinguish present action from the past.

A close reading of Wolfe suggests some strategies to achieve mastery of the long sentence: • It helps if subject and verb of the main clause come early in the sentence. • Use the long sentence to describe something long. Let form follow function. • It helps if the long sentence is written in chronological order. • Use the long sentence in variation with sentences of short and medium length. • Use the long sentence as a list or catalog of products, names, images. • Long sentences need more editing than short ones. Make every word count. Even. In. A. Very. Long. Sentence.

Punctuation comes from the Latin root punctus, or “point.” Those funny dots, lines, and squiggles help writers point the way. To help readers, we punctuate for two reasons: 1. To set the pace of reading. 2. To divide words, phrases, and ideas into convenient groupings.

Think of a long, well-written sentence with no punctuation except the period. Such a sentence is a straight road with a stop sign at the end. The period is the stop sign. Now think of a winding road with lots of stop signs. That analogy describes a paragraph with lots of periods, an effect that will slow the pace of the story. The writer may desire such a pace for strategic reasons: to achieve clarity, convey emotion, or create suspense.

If a period is a stop sign, then what kind of traffic flow is created by other marks? The comma is a speed bump; the semicolon is what a driver education teacher calls a “rolling stop”; the parenthetical expression is a detour; the colon is a flashing yellow light that announces something important up ahead; the dash is a tree branch in the road.

If your goal is to achieve precision and concision, begin by pruning the big limbs. You can shake out the dead leaves later. • Cut any passage that does not support your focus. • Cut the weakest quotations, anecdotes, and scenes to give greater power to the strongest. • Cut any passage you have written to satisfy a tough teacher or editor rather than the common reader. • Don’t invite others to cut. You know the work better. Mark optional trims. Then decide whether they should become actual cuts.

Targets for cuts include: • Adverbs that intensify rather than modify: just, certainly, entirely, extremely, completely, exactly. • Prepositional phrases that repeat the obvious: in the story, in the article, in the movie, in the city. • Phrases that grow on verbs: seems to, tends to, should have to, tries to. • Abstract nouns that hide active verbs: consideration becomes considers; judgment becomes judges; observation becomes observes. • Restatements: a sultry, humid afternoon.

I am often stunned by the power that authors generate with words of a single syllable, as in this passage from Amy Tan: The mother accepted this and closed her eyes. The sword came down and sliced back and forth, up and down, whish! whish! whish! And the mother screamed and shouted, cried out in terror and pain. But when she opened her eyes, she saw no blood, no shredded flesh. The girl said, “Do you see now?” (from The Joy Luck Club) Fifty-five words in all, forty-eight of one syllable. Only one word (“accepted”) of three syllables.

Remember that clear prose is not just a product of sentence length and word choice. It derives first from a sense of purpose—a determination to inform. What comes next is the hard work of reporting, research, and critical thinking. The writer cannot make something clear until the difficult subject is clear in the writer’s head. Then, and only then, does she reach into the writer’s toolbox, ready to explain to readers, “Here’s how it works.”

For example, I once wrote this sentence to describe a writing tool: “Long sentences create a flow that carries the reader down a stream of understanding, creating an effect that Don Fry calls ‘steady advance.’” It took several years and hundreds of readings before I noticed I had written “create” and “creating” in the same sentence. It was easy enough to cut “creating,” giving the stronger verb form its own space. Word territory.

What’s in a name? For the attentive writer, and the eager reader, the answer can be fun, insight, charm, aura, character, identity, psychosis, fulfillment, inheritance, decorum, indiscretion, and possession. For in some cultures, if I know your name and can speak it, I own your soul.

In his book 100 Ways to Improve Your Writing, Gary Provost created this tour de force to demonstrate what happens when the writer experiments with sentences of different lengths: This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals—sounds that say listen to this, it is important. So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader’s ear. Don’t just write words. Write music.

So if you have a writing job, write in your head. Clear up the inconsistencies while you’re brushing your teeth. Get your thoughts organized while you’re driving to work. Think of a slant during lunch. And most important, come up with a beginning, a lead, so that you won’t end up staring at your keyboard as if it had just arrived from another galaxy. If you have spent time writing in your head, you’ll have a head start. The writing will come easier, and you’ll finish sooner.

The bottom of the ladder rests on concrete language. Concrete is hard, which is why when you fall off the ladder from a high place, you might break your foot. Your right foot. The one with the spider tattoo. The second noun is abstraction. You can’t eat it or smell it or measure it. It is not easy to use as a case study. It appeals not to the senses, but to the intellect.

“Voice is the sum of all the strategies used by the author to create the illusion that the writer is speaking directly to the reader from the page.” The most important words in that definition are “create,” “illusion,” and “speaking”: voice is an effect created by the writer that reaches the reader through his ears, even when he is receiving the message through his eyes.

When the story grows to any significant length, the writer should label the parts. If the story evolves into a book, the chapters will have titles. In a newspaper or magazine, the parts may carry subheadlines or subtitles. Writers should write these subtitles themselves—even if the publisher does not use them.

This opening fell flat, I think, because of the adjective “compassionate.” Too often, writers turn abstractions into adjectives to define character. One writer tells us the shopkeeper was enthusiastic, or that the lawyer was passionate in his closing argument, or that the schoolgirls were popular. Some adjectives—ashen, blond, and winged—help us see. But adjectives such as enthusiastic are abstract nouns in disguise.

Some writers talk about doing research until they arrive at a dominant impression, something they can express in a single sentence. For example, “The mother of the cheerleader is over-bearing and controlling.”They may never write that sentence. Instead, they try to re-create for the reader the evidence that led them to this conclusion. Try out this method on some of your stories.

I conclude with a strategy I call Hitchcock’s Leg of Lamb. A 1958 episode of Alfred Hitchcock’s mystery series told the story of a pregnant housewife who kills her cheating husband with a frozen leg of lamb, and then feeds the murder weapon to the investigating detectives. Written by Roald Dahl, the action in this dark comedy is prefigured in its title, “Lamb to the Slaughter.”

“Everything has a purpose, or premise,” he writes. For Romeo and Juliet, it is “Great love defies even death.” For Macbeth, it is “Ruthless ambition leads to its own destruction.” For Othello, it is “Jealousy destroys itself and the object of its love.” The premise takes the question of the engine and turns it into a thematic statement. It can easily be converted back: Will Othello’s jealousy destroy him and the woman he loves?

commonplace of Shakespeare studies is the importance of act 3. The first two acts build toward a moment of powerful insight or action; the last two resolve the tension that forms midway through the play. In other words, the Bard places a huge gold coin right in the middle of his plays.

Repetition works in writing, but only if you intend it. Repeating key words, phrases, and story elements creates a rhythm, a pace, a structure, a wavelength that reinforces the central theme of the work. Such repetition works in music, in literature, in advertising, in humor, in political speech and rhetoric, in teaching, in homilies, in parental lectures—even in this sentence, where the word “in” is repeated ten times.

These words, for example, from the book Night by Elie Wiesel, are attached to a wall of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum: Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.

Repetition can be so powerful, in fact, that it can threaten to call attention to itself, overshadowing the message of the story. If you’re worried about too much repetition, apply this little test: Delete all the repetition and read the passage aloud without it. Repeat the key element once. Repeat it again. Your voice and ear will let you know when you’ve gone too far.

A thousand years ago, the unnamed poet who composed the epic Beowulf knew how to write cinematically. He could pull back the lens to establish heroic settings of land and sea; and he could move in close to see the jeweled fingers of the queen or the demonic light in a monster’s eyes.

• Aerial view. The writer looks down on the world, as if standing atop a skyscraper or viewing the ground from a blimp. Example: “Hundreds and hundreds of black South African voters stood for hours on long, sandy serpentine lines waiting to cast their ballots for the first time.”

• Establishing shot. The writer stands back to capture the setting in which action takes place, describing the world that the reader is about to enter, sometimes creating a mood for the story. Example: “Within seconds, as dusty clouds rose over the school grounds, their great widths suggesting blasts of terrifying force, bursts of rifle fire began to sound, quickly building to a sustained and rolling roar.”

• Middle distance. The camera moves closer to the action, close enough to see the key players and their interaction. This is the common distance for most stories written for the newspaper.

• Close-up. The camera gets in the face of the subject, close enough to detect anger, fear, dread, sorrow, irony, the full range of emotions. Example: “His brow furrowed and the crow’s feet deepened as he struggled to understand.… The man pulled at the waistband of his beige work pants and scratched his sun-aged face. He stared at her, stalling for time as he tried to understand, but afraid to say he didn’t.”

• Extreme close-up. This writer focuses on an important detail that would be invisible from a distance: the pinky ring on the mobster’s finger, the date circled on the wall calendar, the can of beer atop a police car. Example: “The hand of the cancer-care nurse scooped the dead angel fish out of the office aquarium. Patients at this clinic had enough on their minds. They didn’t need another reminder of mortality.”

“As the atom is the smallest discrete unit of matter,” writes novelist Holly Lisle on her Web site, so the scene is the smallest discrete unit in fiction; it is the smallest bit of fiction that contains the essential elements of story. You don’t build a story or a book of words and sentences and paragraphs—you build it of scenes, one piled on top of the next, each changing something that came before, all of them moving the story inexorably and relentlessly forward.

The mirror remains a powerful metaphor for the aspiring writer, especially the journalist. The writer’s goal is to reflect the world, to render the here and now, so that readers can see it, feel it, understand it. But the job of the writer is not merely to capture scenes and compile them. These scenes, these moments within scenes, must be placed in a meaningful order, a storyboard, a script, a sequence.

Many newspapers and magazines have miniaturized this movement with a device called the nut paragraph. Any story that begins without the news requires a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph, a zone that answers the question “So what?” The nut paragraph answers that question for the reader.

• The apt quote. Some characters speak in endings, capturing in their own words a neat summary or distillation of what has come before. In most cases, the writer can write it better than a character can say it. But not always.

I end with a warning. Avoid endings that go on and on like a Rachmaninoff concerto or a heavy metal ballad. Don’t bury your ending. Put your hand over the last paragraph. Ask yourself, “What would happen if this ended here?” Move it up another paragraph and ask the same question until you find the natural stopping place.

I believe that the so-called “writing block” is a product of some kind of disproportion between your standards and your performance.… One should lower his standards until there is no felt threshold to go over in writing. It’s easy to write. You just shouldn’t have standards that inhibit you from writing. (from Writing the Australian Crawl)

Here are some reading tricks for writers: • Read to listen to the voice of the writer. • Read the newspaper in search of underdeveloped story ideas. • Read online to experience a variety of new storytelling forms. • Read entire books when they compel you; but also taste bits of books. • In choosing what to read, be directed less by the advice of others and more by your writing compass. • Sample—for free—a wide selection of current magazines and journals in bookstores that serve coffee. • Read on topics outside your discipline, such as architecture, astronomy, economics, and photography. • Read with a pen nearby. Write in the margins. Talk back to the author. Mark interesting passages. Ask questions of the text.

Godwin draws her central images from Freud, who quotes Friedrich von Schiller: “In the case of a creative mind… the intellect has withdrawn its watchers from the gates, and the ideas rush in… and only then does it review and inspect the multitude.” Schiller chides a friend: “You reject too soon and discriminate too severely.”

The Voice will be a more useful critic, I say immodestly, after exposure to this set of tools. Armed with tools, the Voice might say, “Do you need that adverb?” Or, “Is this the place for a gold coin?” Or, “Isn’t it time for you to climb down the ladder of abstraction and offer a good example?”

Journalists call this a “nose for news,” but all good writers express a form of curiosity, a sense that something is going on out there, something that teases your attention, something in the air. • Explore ideas. The writers I admire most are the ones who see their world as a storehouse of story ideas. They are explorers, traveling through their communities with their senses alert, connecting seemingly unrelated details into story patterns. Most writers I know, even the ones who work from assignments, like to transform the topics of those assignments into their own focused ideas.

• Find a focus. What is your essay about? No, what is it really about? Go deeper. Get to the heart of the matter. Break the shell and extract the nut. Getting there requires careful research, sifting through evidence, experimentation, and critical thinking. The focus of a story can be expressed in a title, a first sentence, a summary paragraph, a theme statement, a thesis, a question the story will answer for the reader, one perfect word.

Using short sentences to their full effect is a centuries-old strategy, found in opinion writing, fiction and nonfiction, poetry and plays. It works in a formal speech or in a handwritten letter. Shakespeare, remember, had a messenger deliver the news to Macbeth in six words: “The Queen, my lord, is dead,” a message that could fit easily inside a 140-character tweet.

A long sequence of short sentences slows the reader, each period acting as a stop sign. That slow pace can bring clarity, create suspense, or magnify emotion, but can soon become tedious. It turns out that the short sentence gains power from its proximity to longer sentences, as Orwell demonstrates with that final image of the whip appearing after a sentence that stretches to thirty-eight words.

To write better character descriptions, hone your powers of observation. In office waiting rooms or airport lounges, at church services, or on commuter trains, watch people closely, paying attention to the details that set them apart. Now imagine describing them in a scene and in that particular setting.

While most inciting incidents are destructive—corpse is found, plane flies into building, hurricane hits New Orleans—not all of them are. Look for stories that fall into the “be careful what you wish for” category: man wins lottery, woman is given expensive engagement ring, friendly wizard shows up at your birthday party. It is in these seemingly positive narrative contexts that a perceived blessing can turn out to be a curse, leading to dramatic action.

To strike a balance between snoozer "the city council voted" sentences and sleazy "there's a killer in your kitchen" sentences, all you have to do is remember the Reader. Ask, "What's important to my Reader?" not just, "What will get his attention?" The answer—be it about the bumpy ride on Main Street or the bottom line on a tax bill—then becomes the main point of your sentence, and your sentence can become a thing of real value.

But such an opening can, in unskilled hands, pave the way for a problematic sentence. At the very least, it tells the Reader, "Stay put. It could be a while before I get to the point."

The problem they can create is sometimes called upside-down subordination. It's a simple concept. It means that a sentence inadvertently takes some less interesting piece of information like John was tired and treats it as though it were more notable than John shot his business partner in the face. Occasionally, that might be exactly what the writer intended. But often it's accidental and undermines the sentence.

These subordinators all have one thing in common: They subordinate. They relegate information to less critical status. They tell the Reader, "This is just minor info we have to get out of the way before we get to the really big news" or "We're tacking this on as an afterthought to really big news."

Since is a controversial subordinating conjunction. Some people say it can't be used as a synonym for because.

Another problem with our longer sentence: extra words can have a diluting effect. In I killed him even though I didn't want to because he gave me no choice, the linking terms even though and because seem mealymouthed. It's like the writer is scrambling to explain herself, speaking from a weak, pleading position. It's almost ironic how the facts stand stronger when they stand alone, unmitigated by the writer's urge to overexplain: I killed him. I didn't want to. He gave me no choice.

A Reader of fiction—be it popular or literary fiction—wants to be told a story. If you can craft metaphors that enhance that story, do. If you can craft metaphors that are so beautiful that they can stand on their own—that they can provide the Reader with as much pleasure as the story—that's an art in itself. But as a rule, if a turn of phrase, a parallel, a comparison, or a metaphor doesn't enhance your Reader's experience, cash it in for straightforward language.

Like all words, manner adverbs should be carefully chosen. They should carry some benefit that overrides the less-is-more principle. They should not create redundancies, and they should be free of that weak "look at me" quality to which they're so prone. They should not appear to be telling the stuff that your nouns and verbs should be showing.

The relative pronouns, according to The Oxford English Grammar, are which, that, and who or whom. Some people include certain uses of where and when, but most authorities don't. Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses:

A relative clause postmodifies a noun. That's a fancy way of saying that it comes after a noun and describes it. So relative clauses are really modifiers that act like adjectives to describe, qualify, or limit some other word in the sentence.

First, relative clauses can be either restrictive or nonrestrictive. Second, this distinction is at the center of a controversy over how you can use the word which. Third, there exists something called the zero relative, which refers to the absence of a relative pronoun at the head of a relative clause. Fourth, sometimes it's easy to mistake a subordinating conjunction for a relative pronoun.

Restrictive and nonrestrictive refer to the job a clause performs in a sentence. A restrictive clause can't be removed from a sentence without harming the point of the main clause: Any house that I buy must be yellow. The relative clause here is that 1 buy. To test whether it's restrictive or nonrestrictive, take it out. You end up with Any house must be yellow.

They're a big clue. The commas tell you that the information they set off is nonessential, often called parenthetical information. So restrictive relative clauses do not take commas but nonrestrictive relative clauses do.

Compare these two sentences: The ceremony will honor the athletes, who won. The ceremony will honor the athletes who won. That little comma makes a world of difference. In the first sentence, all the athletes won. In the second sentence, we see that only some athletes won and they're the ones who will be honored. The difference hinges on just one comma because that comma signals whether the clause that follows is restrictive or nonrestrictive.

Remember: relative clauses are modifiers (just like adjectives) but subordinate clauses can be used as subjects and objects (just like nouns). To spot the difference, just determine whether the whole that clause is modifying a noun: The family that stays together. If so, it's a relative pronoun. If that is followed by a whole clause it's a subordinating conjunction: That you love me is all I need to know. Harry learned that life is not fair.

Relative clauses seem to work best when they cast a little extra light on a thing or an idea. But they can quickly become a problem when they're used to insert history or backstory. They're at their worst when they contain an unstated "Oh, by the way" or "I never took the time to mention this before, so let me squeeze something in now."

A participle is a verb form that usually ends in ing, ed, or en. The -ing form is called the progressive participle. The -ed and -en forms are called past participles, though irregular verbs don't follow the pattern: shown, brought, led, dealt, leapt, seen, and so on, are all past participles. Past participles work with forms of have and progressive participles work with forms of be to form different verb conjugations: We have walked, Joe is walking, and so on.

A participial phrase or clause, then, is simply any participle that serves as a modifier. And it can do so with or without accessories: Exhausted, Harry fell into bed. Exhausted from the long hike, Harry fell into bed. Speeding, Nanette hit a pole. Speeding in her Ferrari, Nanette hit a pole. Eating, Dave almost choked. Eating pastrami, Dave almost choked. Either way, a participial phrase or clause can be seen as a modifier. It modifies a noun or pronoun. So from our examples, who was exhausted? Harry. And who was speeding? Nanette. Harry and Nanette are the nouns being modified by those participial units. Now identify what's wrong with this sentence: Daydreaming about Nanette, Dan's foot went right into a puddle.

You can also make your participial phrase or clause into a subordinate clause so it's no longer a modifier and therefore no longer has to be right next to whatever it's modifying: While Dan was daydreaming about Nanette, his foot went right into a puddle. That's it. That's as hard it gets. Get past the fear of the grammar jargon and you see that dangling participles are very simple. Participles aren't the only things that can dangle: A Kentucky Derby-winning colt, Thunderbolt's jockey was very proud. Did you catch it? We just called the jockey a colt. This is a tricky one because it looks as though the colt, Thunderbolt, comes right after the modifier. But no. We didn't write Thunderbolt. We wrote Thunderbolt's, rendering it a modifier.

When you lay out two options, there's no need to first insert a sentence saying that you're about to lay out two options. Also, after the writer said she was about to lay out two options, she dedicated a whole sentence to evaluating one of the options she had yet to lay out. Whenever you find yourself buried under so many words, start by asking: can't I just chop all this out? The answer is usually yes.

If you're getting into trouble with a long sentence, you can chop it into shorter sentences. If your adverb-laden sentence falls flat, you can just ditch the adverbs.

Linking verbs Adjectives can often be found in combination with linking verbs. Linking verbs are verbs that connect a subject with an adjective or noun. Examples are was/were , is/are , felt , appeared , seemed , looked . The problem with them is that they are weak, static verbs that don’t show us an action. Replace most of them with more active verbs.

9) Filters Filter words are verbs that describe the character perceiving or thinking something, for example, saw , smelled , heard , felt , watched , noticed , realized , wondered , and knew . The problem is that filter words tell your readers what the character perceives or thinks instead of letting them experience it directly.

1) Use the five senses Showing means letting your readers experience your story world along with the point of view character. Try to engage all of your readers’ senses, not just sight. In every scene, put yourself in your POV character’s shoes and describe what he can see, hear, smell, taste, and sense.

Be careful not to overdo it, though. If you use too many metaphors and similes, your writing will come across as pretentious and overwritten. Metaphors and similes can also become clichés, so try not to use the first thing that comes to mind.

Backstory is often dumped on readers much too soon . I often see manuscripts in which the character sits and thinks about her past in chapter one. The opening pages isn’t the best place to reveal a character’s backstory because readers haven’t become emotionally involved yet.

Use the iceberg principle : While you as the author know every little detail about how your characters grew up, what jobs they had in the past, and what relationships shaped them, readers don’t need to know all of that. Most of that should stay hidden beneath the surface while readers see only the tip of the iceberg.

Turn the backstory into story by bringing the past into the present . For example, in my novel Just Physical , my main character is a stuntwoman who got hurt in a fire stunt in the past. But instead of telling my readers that fact, I show her fear as she has to do a fire stunt in the present.

In order to reveal backstory through dialogue in a realistic way, though, you need one character who doesn’t know about the piece of backstory already. Don’t create As-you-know-Bob dialogue in which characters talk about things they both already know and have no reason to talk about, just so readers can be brought up to speed. Example from my novel Hidden Truths : “Call me Phin.” He reached for her hand and rested it in the crook of his elbow, then set them off for a stroll along the corrals. “When you call me Phineas, I feel like my father is standin’ behind me.” “And that wouldn’t be a good thing?” “No. My father was a real bastard.” He blanched.

The advice most editors give to writers about flashbacks is not to use them, though. Flashbacks jerk the reader out of the flow of the story and stop the book’s forward momentum. Often, it would be better to use a few lines of telling to avoid using a flashback.

Use verb tense to signal the start and the end of a flashback. Assuming your novel is told in the past tense, use past perfect (e.g., had seen) two or three times when you enter a flashback and then show us the scene with action and dialogue in simple past tense (e.g., saw). Writing the entire flashback scene in past perfect would be too cumbersome.

Showing is a signal to readers that what you’re writing about is important, so they’d better pay attention. If you show everything, readers will assume everything is important and they’ll eventually become exhausted. The really important things won’t stand out anymore.

Often, these are everyday activities such as taking a shower, getting dressed, driving to work, or cooking dinner. You’re writing a novel, not a cook book, so you don’t need to provide a step-by-step description of your character preparing dinner—unless it’s important to the plot, for example, she’s adding poison to the spaghetti sauce.

5) Pacing If you show too much, it can slow down the pace of your story. If you show every little thing, you will end up with a dragging 500,000-word novel. So whenever showing would disrupt the forward momentum of your story, you can tell instead. Telling is great if you need to deliver a piece of information to the reader quickly, without slowing down the pace.

Here’s how to make your telling more effective: Make sure it’s a piece of information that readers really need to have. Avoid repetition. Never tell something that you have already shown. Keep it short. Use strong, vivid verbs and concrete nouns. Make it interesting! Readers won’t even notice that you’re telling if a sentence or a paragraph grabs their attention. Example

One is the non-rivalry in consumption—you watched the street performance, but you did not prevent others from viewing it, too. Thus, there was no rivalry in the consumption of the service among different consumers. That is not so with other goods, say, a car or a toothpaste. If you buy a car, that same car is not available to anyone else.

The second factor is this: at a given market price, the relative buying power of different consumers might exclude some of them from buying the car or the toothpaste. In the case of the street-performing couple, this ‘excludability’ feature is missing, because they cannot prevent individuals—either physically or by charging an appropriate price—from viewing the performance. Thus, due to the non-rivalry and the non-excludability of the service which they provide, the problem of free riding occurs, and the market fails to deliver—ergo, the street performers cannot run a profitable business.

Private firms will not offer these services, because the free market cannot provide the required environment for making a profit. In this sense, the market fails to deliver these services, and the institution of government has to undertake these economic activities. Even in hardcore capitalist economies, these services are provided by the government.

The per-unit cost of delivering potable tap water would come down only if a single firm were to offer this service. That way, there would be no duplication of capital costs, and the capital cost for a single operator would get distributed over the large volume of water delivered. This implies that there is room only for a single firm—that is, a monopoly.

In the absence of competition from other players, a profit-maximizing monopolist would charge a high price for water delivery, and the quantity supplied would also be quite low compared to what it would have been under competitive conditions. Goods and services that fall into this category are called ‘natural monopolies’.

governments often allow private monopolies to run utilities as long as their pricing and output levels are regulated by the government. Some firms, such as, Tata Power (Mumbai) and Torrent Power (Ahmedabad), are examples of private firms running electric utilities very efficiently, but their pricing and output decisions are regulated by the state electricity regulatory commissions.

This happens when economic activities are characterized by what is known in economics as ‘externality’. Externality occurs when a specific economic activity—production, consumption, or trade—affects a bystander who is not party to the specific economic activity.

The social benefit of the electric car far exceeds the private benefit to the consumer. This means that there is a positive externality enjoyed by society when an individual buys a Reva. The government would certainly want to encourage more production of Reva and, hence, it offers a subsidy so that more such cars (and fewer petrol-driven cars) are manufactured and bought.

High taxes on liquor and tobacco also demonstrate the government’s efforts to curtail consumption as it perceives a significant negative externality on society.

In a broader sense, these policies can also be interpreted as measures for reducing negative externalities: inflation and unemployment lead to lower real incomes for households and make fewer goods and services available to them.

The existence of pure public goods, natural monopolies, and externalities are clear cases of market failures. In such situations, the private sector either cannot provide goods and services profitably, or provides them with a disregard of social costs and social benefits. Therefore, the government has legitimate reasons both for undertaking the economic activities and for intervening in their functioning.

Circa 1760, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England would carry the statement of government finances to the House of Commons in a leather bag. The French word for such a leather bag is bougette, which became budget in English. Thus, the Chancellor would present the ‘budget’ in the House of Commons.

While the Indian government, for all its civil and administrative purposes, follows the Gregorian calendar that begins on January 1, it mandates a different twelve-month period called the fiscal year for taxation, budget, and financial reporting by the private sector. The fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. The government has to operationalize the budget from April 1.

there is the Public Account which holds amounts which are held by the government in trust. These include items such as the Employees’ Provident Fund and the Small Savings Collections. The funds in these items do not belong to the government, and have to be eventually returned to the people who have deposited them. No parliamentary approval is needed for such payments, except when the amounts are withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund and kept in the Public Account for specific expenditures (for example, road construction).

All the expenditures incurred on the functioning of the judiciary, maintaining law and order, routine administration, salaries, subsidies, pensions for the administrative staff, and payments on past debts are classified as revenue expenditures. Essentially, these are expenditures that do not lead to the creation of assets and are used up for the normal functioning of the government.

The first is the Revenue Deficit, which measures the difference between revenue expenditure and revenue receipts. A deficit of this kind shows the management of government finances in a poor light, for it shows that the government has to borrow money to finance administrative activities which do not lead to the creation of any assets.

The second type of deficit is the Fiscal Deficit, which refers to the difference between the government’s total expenditure and the total non-debt receipts. In short, this indicates that the government has exhausted all options for financing its expenditure, and the only recourse left is to borrow. Thus, Fiscal Deficit shows the total debt generated by the government to finance the total budget expenditure. Such a deficit is justified as long as the expenditures are being incurred to finance activities leading to the creation of national assets.

Yet another deficit that is considered by an incumbent government is the Primary Deficit. This deficit is defined as the difference between the Fiscal Deficit and the interest payment on debts incurred in earlier years. If one removes the interest payments from the Fiscal Deficit, the Primary Deficit becomes a smaller number. The incumbent government uses this statistic to show that the interest payments on the previous debt are not of its making. When this component is removed from the Fiscal Deficit and the resultant deficit turns out to be very small, it proves the prudent management of the budget by the incumbent government.

When the government’s Fiscal Deficit is large, it implies that the government has to borrow heavily. This means that the demand for loans will rise in the market, causing interest rates to go up. As interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing for private firms goes up. As the cost of borrowing rises, firms find that fewer and fewer investment projects are economically viable.

When the rupee appreciates in this manner, one US dollar fetches fewer rupees and, therefore, Indian exports become expensive and imports become cheaper. This results in lower exports and higher imports for India, leading to a higher trade deficit for the country. Thus, a high Fiscal Deficit may lead to a very high trade deficit.

Third, the Horizontal Equity and the Vertical Equity Principles state that those who are equal should be taxed equally, and those who are unequal must be taxed unequally.

These Equity principles essentially focus on the issue of fairness.

Verbals are verb forms that work as other parts of speech. They are • gerunds—the -ing form of a verb working as a noun: Dancing is good exercise. • participles—usually an -ing, -ed, or -en form. When a participle works as a modifier instead of as part of a verb, it qualifies as a verbal: A man covered with bee stings came into the hospital. A child skipping to school is probably happy. • infinitives—a verb form introduced by the infinitival to: to run, to know, to become. Infinitives can act as subjects: To know him is to love him. But infinitives are also said to act as adjectives by modifying nouns (There are many ways to travel) and as adverbs by modifying adjectives (I am happy to help).

• The subjunctive mood indicates statements contrary to fact (such as wishes and suppositions), propositions and suggestions, and commands, demands, and statements of necessity. Some uses of the subjunctive are dead or dying. In modern usage, it's most useful to think of the subjunctive as follows: In the past tense, the subjunctive applies only to the verb to be, and it is conjugated as were. The form differs from the indicative only for the first-person singular and the third-person singular.

For example, if the sales proceeds of an apparel manufacturing firm are Rs 1 million, and the cost of materials consumed, such as, textile, leather, buttons, and electricity, is Rs 600,000, then VAT will be applied only on Rs 400,000, not on Rs 1 million.

If a government does not levy tax, that is, the tax rate is zero, there will be no tax revenue. As the tax rate increases, so will the tax revenue until the tax rate reaches an optimal level T. If the tax rate rises above T, the tax revenue will begin to fall. Of course, at 100 percent tax rate, the tax revenue would be zero since it would completely discourage all economic activity.

the idea is that, after the level of optimal tax rate T, any increase in the tax rate would lead to a substantive disincentive to work, and the resultant fall in GDP would lower the tax revenue. High tax rates may also lead to tax evasion which is illegal. Thus, whether or not tax revenue will increase or decrease when the tax rate is changed depends upon which side of the hump the original tax rate is.

These cash balances facilitate the exchange of goods and services, including the buying (and selling) of financial or real assets.

These deposit receipts were used as money, which were actually a proxy for the people’s silver and gold held with the goldsmiths. Thus, private currency notes began to get issued and circulated.

Its origin can be traced to the 1850s, when share brokers used to gather under a banyan tree for trading, and they formed an official organization in 1875 known as The Native Share and Stock Brokers’ Association. After Independence, BSE was the first in the country to be granted permanent recognition under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act of 1956.

Therefore, specialized firms evolved into what are called mutual fund managers, which invest in shares on behalf of small individual customers. Individuals invest in the mutual funds of these specialized financial firms which, in turn, invest in shares of different companies on behalf of the individual customers. Mutual funds have come as a big relief to small investors who can take advantage of the expertise of mutual fund managers in getting a sound return on their financial investments.

The statement from his treatise quoted at the beginning of this chapter underlines the basic premise in economics—the self-interest of each economic agent compels them to specialize in the production of what they are good at and to exchange it with others to satisfy their needs. He believed that such self-interest-driven specialization and exchange maximizes a society’s welfare.

Competitive efforts by various countries, consisting of imposition of quotas, VERs, bans, and high customs duties, in general, and the devaluation of their respective currencies, in particular, are termed as beggar-thy-neighbour policies. They are so called because each country tries to offer an advantage to the domestic industry at the cost of other countries. In the process—when every country does this—it leads to an almost autarkic (no-trade among countries) situation, and worsens trade, production, and employment prospects everywhere.

For example, a hallmark of WTO is the principle of non-discrimination among member countries. This principle, christened as the MFN principle in Article I of GATT, mandates that the trade policy treatment which a member country metes out to its most favoured nation should also be meted out to all other member countries. In essence, simply put, it means that all member countries have to be given MFN status. For example, if India removes quota restrictions on the import of agricultural products from a particular country, the quota removal must apply to all the other member countries as well.

The catch is that an exemption is granted by Article XXI of GATT which allows member countries to apply trade controls if they are deemed necessary due to concerns of national security. By not granting each other MFN status in 1995, both India and Pakistan had exercised the use of this exemption at the time of the formation of WTO.

the ‘bound rates’ of customs duties—the maximum rates of customs duties which a country may charge on imported goods—are very high. The bound rates are naturally higher than the actual customs duties charged by a country. The average bound rates for agricultural imports are still above 113 percent in India. In fact, the maximum bound rate for animal products, dairy products, and fruits and vegetables is 150 percent. Therefore, in the Doha Round, one of the expectations of the developed countries is that the developing countries give better market access to them.

WTO allows imposition of Anti-Dumping duties. Dumping has a special meaning in WTO agreements. If an exporter sells a good in a foreign market for a CIF (cost, insurance, freight) price which is lower than its normal value in the exporter’s domestic market, it is considered as ‘dumping’. Essentially, the normal value refers to the fact that the domestic price (in exporter’s market) is not lower than the cost of production.

Hence, inflation is said to occur when most of the prices start rising due to the relative shortage of those goods. Inflation is triggered either by a general increase in the demand for goods and services relative to their supply, or by a general fall in the supply of goods and services relative to their demand.

Shortage of crude oil and the resultant high prices of goods which use crude oil in the market result in overall smaller quantities of goods being purchased in the market. This leads to a general reduction in output and employment in the economy. Such an inflation that leads to a lowering of output and employment is known as Stagflation.

Shortage of food and agricultural raw material in relation to the demand leads to a rise in the cost of production and prices in most sectors of the economy. Volumes traded in the market suffer due to high prices. Inventories mount up, sending a signal to firms to produce less. The result is high prices accompanied by lowered output and employment, in other words, stagflation.

For example, with regular frequency, the government offers support prices to farmers for rice, wheat, sugar cane, cotton, and many other cash crops. Of course, these support prices are higher than the free market price. Such price supports increase the cost of production in industries which use agricultural produce as raw material. Overall, therefore, administered prices may result in inflation.

When the demand for goods or services exceeds the existing output levels in the economy, the result is inflation. The cause of an increase in demand could be increased exports, a rise in household and firm spending, increased government purchases, and/or central bank operations.

Brighter business prospects imply a higher profitability for firms, and this gets reflected in the higher prices of equity/shares in the stock market. And as the wealth of households goes up in the form of high-value shares or equity stocks, they start spending more on goods and services.

We must note at this time, however, that a small measure of demand–pull inflation is considered good for the economy as it gives an incentive to producers to produce more. And, if the output level rises as a result of a moderate rise in price, inflation stays in check.

This postulate is popularly described by an equation: M V = P Y where M is the money supply in the economy (we have defined what is ‘money’ in an earlier chapter); P is the price level or the index number prevailing in a given period of time; Y is the level of output in the economy; and V is the velocity of money. Velocity of money refers to the average number of times a unit of currency (say, a rupee or a mark) is used in a given period of time. The right-hand side of the equation shows that P times Y (PY) is nothing but the current or nominal GDP as we have defined it in an earlier chapter. If the velocity of money is V, to carry out transactions related to the PY level of GDP, one needs to have M units of money. On an average, each unit of M will be used V times during a given period.

Now, it is easy to see that if and are constants, an increase in money supply M will only lead to an increase in price level P. This is exactly what happened in Germany in the early 1920s. A substantive increase in the money supply to pay for war reparations and wages without production led to a substantive increase in the price level alone, for the output in the economy was held almost constant in relation to the gigantic increases in money supply.

Businesses, on the other hand, may not lose as their revenues increase with increasing prices. Thus, inflation results in a redistribution of income that is unfavourable to fixed-income earners. The same can be said of debtors and creditors.

Therefore, between debtors and creditors, inflation causes a redistribution of real income in favour of debtors. And, because the real value of cash holdings goes down, one would like to spend before prices rise further, to save less, and to borrow more! As a society, such changes in real income distribution and spending habits are certainly worrisome.

When individuals sell shares at a high price, they make capital gains which are taxable. Part of the rise in share prices may simply be due to the inflationary factor and part may be pure capital gains accruing to the relative high price of the share. Thus, one may need to adjust the total capital gains by removing the inflationary factor.

However, inflation in moderation may do some good as well. It is argued that a little inflation offers an incentive to firms to produce more. To produce more, additional labour is required, leading to greater employment, and there will be more available for society’s consumption.

It excludes prices of services but includes prices of raw materials, semifinished products, and even imported commodities that are traded at the wholesale level. Therefore, WPI reflects the inflation that is posed to the industrial sector of the economy.

A rise in the cost of production ultimately leads to a rise in the retail prices paid by the consumer. Therefore, cost–push inflation is likely to get reflected first in WPI and subsequently in CPI and, hence the name, headline inflation.

on different occasions, the Indian government has brought customs duties down to zero on import of rice, wheat, pulses, crude edible oils, butter, ghee, raw sugar, and onions.

OMO refers to the buying and selling of government securities by RBI in the market. When RBI sells government securities in the market, banks and financial institutions buy them and money flows from the private sector to RBI, resulting in lowering the deposit amounts in commercial banks. This reduces the cash in banks which is needed to create multiple deposits and to extend loans. Hence, through the multiplier effect, the ability of banks to give loans comes down.

However, LAF mandates that banks must repurchase the same securities at a later date. The securities are repurchased by the banks at a price higher than their selling price. Essentially, the difference in the two prices expressed as an annualized percentage of the selling price is the repo rate. Thus, the repo rate is nothing but the short-term interest rate at which commercial banks borrow from RBI.

If the repo rate is increased, it becomes costlier for commercial banks to borrow from RBI. In turn, banks would also give loans to private firms at a higher interest rate. At a higher interest rate, a smaller number of investment projects become viable for the private sector. This causes the demand for investment goods to fall and, thereby, stall inflation.

However, the dollar–rupee exchange rate does not reflect the true purchasing power of the two currencies. This is because the exchange rate is determined only on the basis of the demand and supply of the two currencies that are required for import and export and for financial transactions. Moreover, besides these requirements, there are millions of other goods and services that are traded within each country but not between the two countries. Hence, the dollar–rupee exchange rate may not represent the true value of the purchasing power of the currencies within their respective domestic markets. Therefore, the World Bank looks at what is called purchasing power parity (PPP) incomes.

It determines the PPP every five years by obtaining and coordinating data regarding the prices of a basket of more than 1000 commodities from all countries through its International Comparison Programme (ICP), and identifying the PPP exchange rate of each country in relation to the US dollar. This exchange rate is used to calculate PC–GNI valued at the PPP exchange rate. Essentially, through the PPP exchange rate, ICP answers the question—how much local currency would be required for buying a given basket that may cost $1 in the US?

all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.

The atoms are 1 or 2 × 10-8 cm in radius. Now 10-8 cm is called an angstrom (just as another name), so we say they are 1 or 2 angstroms (Å) in radius. Another way to remember their size is this: if an apple is magnified to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple. Now imagine this great drop of water with all of these jiggling particles stuck together and tagging along with each other. The water keeps its volume; it does not fall apart, because of the attraction of the molecules for each other. If the drop is on a slope, where it can move from one place to another, the water will flow, but it does not just disappear—things do not just fly apart—because of the molecular attraction. Now the jiggling motion is what we represent as heat: when we

All the experiences in your life – from single conversations to your broader culture – shape the microscopic details of your brain. Neurally speaking, who you are depends on where you’ve been. Your brain is a relentless shape-shifter, constantly rewriting its own circuitry – and because your experiences are unique, so are the vast, detailed patterns in your neural networks. Because they continue to change your whole life, your identity is a moving target; it never reaches an endpoint.

Rome’s reaction alternated between aggressive resistance and attempts at accommodation; its failure to develop a workable policy would eventually result in the collapse of the Western empire some three centuries later.

How to act: Never under compulsion, out of selfishness, without forethought, with misgivings. Don’t gussy up your thoughts. No surplus words or unnecessary actions. Let the spirit in you represent a man, an adult, a citizen, a Roman, a ruler. Taking up his post like a soldier and patiently awaiting his recall from life. Needing no oath or witness. Cheerfulness. Without requiring other people’s help. Or serenity supplied by others. To stand up straight—not straightened.

It would be wrong for anything to stand between you and attaining goodness—as a rational being and a citizen. Anything at all: the applause of the crowd, high office, wealth, or self-indulgence. All of them might seem to be compatible with it—for a while. But suddenly they control us and sweep us away.

Your ability to control your thoughts—treat it with respect. It’s all that protects your mind from false perceptions—false to your nature, and that of all rational beings. It’s what makes thoughtfulness possible, and affection for other people, and submission to the divine.

Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been lived already, or is impossible to see. The span we live is small—small as the corner of the earth in which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed from mouth to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant alike of themselves and those long dead.

If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any moment— If you can embrace this without fear or expectation—can find fulfillment in what you’re doing now, as Nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every word, every utterance)—then your life will be happy. No one can prevent that.

Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by accommodating itself to what it faces—to what is possible. It needs no specific material. It pursues its own aims as circumstances allow; it turns obstacles into fuel. As a fire overwhelms what would have quenched a lamp. What’s thrown on top of the conflagration is absorbed, consumed by it—and makes it burn still higher.

People try to get away from it all—to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. Nowhere you can go is more peaceful—more free of interruptions—than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony.

Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us—how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space—and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are.

“If you seek tranquillity, do less.” Or (more accurately) do what’s essential—what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?” But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow.

Don’t let yourself forget how many doctors have died, after furrowing their brows over how many deathbeds. How many astrologers, after pompous forecasts about others’ ends. How many philosophers, after endless disquisitions on death and immortality. How many warriors, after inflicting thousands of casualties themselves. How many tyrants, after abusing the power of life and death atrociously, as if they were themselves immortal. How many whole cities have met their end: Helike, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and countless others. And all the ones you know yourself, one after another. One who laid out another for burial, and was buried himself, and then the man who buried him—all in the same short space of time.

If an action or utterance is appropriate, then it’s appropriate for you. Don’t be put off by other people’s comments and criticism. If it’s right to say or do it, then it’s the right thing for you to do or say. The others obey their own lead, follow their own impulses. Don’t be distracted. Keep walking.

The mind is the ruler of the soul. It should remain unstirred by agitations of the flesh—gentle and violent ones alike. Not mingling with them, but fencing itself off and keeping those feelings in their place. When they make their way into your thoughts, through the sympathetic link between mind and body, don’t try to resist the sensation. The sensation is natural. But don’t let the mind start in with judgments, calling it “good” or “bad.”

How are you to know that an apartment is indeed the best unless you have a baseline to judge it by? And how are you to establish that baseline unless you look at (and lose) a number of apartments? The more information you gather, the better you’ll know the right opportunity when you see it—but the more likely you are to have already passed it by.

Thirty-seven percent. If you want the best odds of getting the best apartment, spend 37% of your apartment hunt (eleven days, if you’ve given yourself a month for the search) noncommittally exploring options. Leave the checkbook at home; you’re just calibrating. But after that point, be prepared to immediately commit—deposit and all—to the very first place you see that beats whatever you’ve already seen. This is not merely an intuitively satisfying compromise between looking and leaping. It is the provably optimal solution.

Optimal stopping tells us when to look and when to leap. The explore/exploit tradeoff tells us how to find the balance between trying new things and enjoying our favorites. Sorting theory tells us how (and whether) to arrange our offices. Caching theory tells us how to fill our closets. Scheduling theory tells us how to fill our time.

Whence 37%? In your search for a secretary, there are two ways you can fail: stopping early and stopping late. When you stop too early, you leave the best applicant undiscovered. When you stop too late, you hold out for a better applicant who doesn’t exist. The optimal strategy will clearly require finding the right balance between the two, walking the tightrope between looking too much and not enough.

the optimal solution takes the form of what we’ll call the Look-Then-Leap Rule: You set a predetermined amount of time for “looking”—that is, exploring your options, gathering data—in which you categorically don’t choose anyone, no matter how impressive. After that point, you enter the “leap” phase, prepared to instantly commit to anyone who outshines the best applicant you saw in the look phase.

A 63% failure rate, when following the best possible strategy, is a sobering fact. Even when we act optimally in the secretary problem, we will still fail most of the time—that is, we won’t end up with the single best applicant in the pool. This is bad news for those of us who would frame romance as a search for “the one.”

For example, assume an immediate proposal is a sure thing but belated proposals are rejected half the time. Then the math says you should keep looking noncommittally until you’ve seen 61% of applicants, and then only leap if someone in the remaining 39% of the pool proves to be the best yet. If you’re still single after considering all the possibilities—as Kepler was—then go back to the best one that got away. The symmetry between strategy and outcome holds in this case once again, with your chances of ending up with the best applicant under this second-chances-allowed scenario also being 61%.

It’s this fact that gives rise to the unavoidable “look” phase, in which we risk passing up a superb early applicant while we calibrate our expectations and standards. Mathematicians refer to this genre of optimal stopping problems as “no-information games.”

We can instead use the Threshold Rule, where we immediately accept an applicant if she is above a certain percentile. We don’t need to look at an initial group of candidates to set this threshold—but we do, however, need to be keenly aware of how much looking remains available.

The math shows that when there are a lot of applicants left in the pool, you should pass up even a very good applicant in the hopes of finding someone still better than that—but as your options dwindle, you should be prepared to hire anyone who’s simply better than average. It’s a familiar, if not exactly inspiring, message: in the face of slim pickings, lower your standards. It also makes clear the converse: with more fish in the sea, raise them. In both cases, crucially, the math tells you exactly by how much.

Finally, if waiting costs half or more of our expected range of offers—in this case, $50,000—then there’s no advantage whatsoever to holding out; we’ll do best by taking the very first offer that comes along and calling it done. Beggars can’t be choosers.

The critical thing to note in this problem is that our threshold depends only on the cost of search. Since the chances of the next offer being a good one—and the cost of finding out—never change, our stopping price has no reason to ever get lower as the search goes on, regardless of our luck. We set it once, before we even begin, and then we quite simply hold fast.

But in house selling and job hunting, even if it’s possible to reconsider an earlier offer, and even if that offer is guaranteed to still be on the table, you should nonetheless never do so.

but perhaps the most appropriate to Berezovsky’s case—with apologies to Russian oligarchs—is known as the “burglar problem.” In this problem, a burglar has the opportunity to carry out a sequence of robberies. Each robbery provides some reward, and there’s a chance of getting away with it each time. But if the burglar is caught, he gets arrested and loses all his accumulated gains. What algorithm should he follow to maximize his expected take?

the number of robberies you should carry out is roughly equal to the chance you get away, divided by the chance you get caught. If you’re a skilled burglar and have a 90% chance of pulling off each robbery (and a 10% chance of losing it all), then retire after 90/10 = 9 robberies.

Because for people there’s always a time cost. It doesn’t come from the design of the experiment. It comes from people’s lives. The “endogenous” time costs of searching, which aren’t usually captured by optimal stopping models, might thus provide an explanation for why human decision-making routinely diverges from the prescriptions of those models. As optimal stopping researcher Neil Bearden puts it, “After searching for a while, we humans just tend to get bored. It’s not irrational to get bored, but it’s hard to model that rigorously.”

As such, the explicit premise of the optimal stopping problem is the implicit premise of what it is to be alive. It’s this that forces us to decide based on possibilities we’ve not yet seen, this that forces us to embrace high rates of failure even when acting optimally. No choice recurs. We may get similar choices again, but never that exact one. Hesitation—inaction—is just as irrevocable as action. What the motorist, locked on the one-way road, is to space, we are to the fourth dimension: we truly pass this way but once.

Every day we are constantly forced to make decisions between options that differ in a very specific dimension: do we try new things or stick with our favorite ones? We intuitively understand that life is a balance between novelty and tradition, between the latest and the greatest, between taking risks and savoring what we know and love.

But the reality is not so simple. Remembering that every “best” song and restaurant among your favorites began humbly as something merely “new” to you is a reminder that there may be yet-unknown bests still out there—and thus that the new is indeed worthy of at least some of our attention.

What’s more, exploration can be a curse. Part of what’s nice about music, for instance, is that there are constantly new things to listen to. Or, if you’re a music journalist, part of what’s terrible about music is that there are constantly new things to listen to. Being a music journalist means turning the exploration dial all the way to 11, where it’s nothing but new things all the time.

In computer science, the tension between exploration and exploitation takes its most concrete form in a scenario called the “multi-armed bandit problem.” The odd name comes from the colloquial term for a casino slot machine, the “one-armed bandit.”

People tend to treat decisions in isolation, to focus on finding each time the outcome with the highest expected value. But decisions are almost never isolated, and expected value isn’t the end of the story. If you’re thinking not just about the next decision, but about all the decisions you are going to make about the same options in the future, the explore/exploit tradeoff is crucial to the process.

Seizing a day and seizing a lifetime are two entirely different endeavors. We have the expression “Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,” but perhaps we should also have its inverse: “Start learning a new language or an instrument, and make small talk with a stranger, because life is long, and who knows what joy could blossom over many years’ time.” When balancing favorite experiences and new ones, nothing matters as much as the interval over which we plan to enjoy them.

A sobering property of trying new things is that the value of exploration, of finding a new favorite, can only go down over time, as the remaining opportunities to savor it dwindle. Discovering an enchanting café on your last night in town doesn’t give you the opportunity to return.

Robbins specifically considered the case where there are exactly two slot machines, and proposed a solution called the Win-Stay, Lose-Shift algorithm: choose an arm at random, and keep pulling it as long as it keeps paying off. If the arm doesn’t pay off after a particular pull, then switch to the other one. Although this simple strategy is far from a complete solution, Robbins proved in 1952 that it performs reliably better than chance.

For every slot machine we know little or nothing about, there is some guaranteed payout rate which, if offered to us in lieu of that machine, will make us quite content never to pull its handle again. This number—which Gittins called the “dynamic allocation index,” and which the world now knows as the Gittins index—suggests an obvious strategy on the casino floor: always play the arm with the highest index.

The old adage tells us that “the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence,” but the math tells us why: the unknown has a chance of being better, even if we actually expect it to be no different, or if it’s just as likely to be worse. The untested rookie is worth more (early in the season, anyway) than the veteran of seemingly equal ability, precisely because we know less about him. Exploration in itself has value, since trying new things increases our chances of finding the best. So taking the future into account, rather than focusing just on the present, drives us toward novelty.

The success of Upper Confidence Bound algorithms offers a formal justification for the benefit of the doubt. Following the advice of these algorithms, you should be excited to meet new people and try new things—to assume the best about them, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. In the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret.

The widespread difficulty with accepting results from adaptive clinical trials might seem incomprehensible. But consider that part of what the advent of statistics did for medicine, at the start of the twentieth century, was to transform it from a field in which doctors had to persuade each other in ad hoc ways about every new treatment into one where they had clear guidelines about what sorts of evidence were and were not persuasive. Changes to accepted standard statistical practice have the potential to upset this balance, at least temporarily.

In an experiment testing this hypothesis, Carstensen and her collaborator Barbara Fredrickson asked people to choose who they’d rather spend thirty minutes with: an immediate family member, the author of a book they’d recently read, or somebody they had met recently who seemed to share their interests. Older people preferred the family member; young people were just as excited to meet the author or make a new friend. But in a critical twist, if the young people were asked to imagine that they were about to move across the country, they preferred the family member too.

What Carstensen and her colleagues found is that the shrinking of social networks with aging is due primarily to “pruning” peripheral relationships and focusing attention instead on a core of close friends and family members. This process seems to be a deliberate choice: as people approach the end of their lives, they want to focus more on the connections that are the most meaningful.

Being sensitive to how much time you have left is exactly what the computer science of the explore/exploit dilemma suggests. We think of the young as stereotypically fickle; the old, stereotypically set in their ways. In fact, both are behaving completely appropriately with respect to their intervals. The deliberate honing of a social network down to the most meaningful relationships is the rational response to having less time to enjoy them.

“To lower costs per unit of output, people usually increase the size of their operations,” wrote J. C. Hosken in 1955, in the first scientific article published on sorting. This is the economy of scale familiar to any business student.

In Bucket Sort, items are grouped together into a number of sorted categories, with no regard for finer, intracategory sorting; that can come later. (In computer science the term “bucket” simply refers to a chunk of unsorted data, but some of the most powerful real-world uses of Bucket Sort, as at the KCLS, take the name entirely literally.)

And one of the most central tradeoffs is between sorting and searching. The basic principle is this: the effort expended on sorting materials is just a preemptive strike against the effort it’ll take to search through them later. What the precise balance should be depends on the exact parameters of the situation, but thinking about sorting as valuable only to support future search tells us something surprising: Err on the side of messiness. Sorting something that you will never search is a complete waste; searching something you never sorted is merely inefficient.

Computer science shows that the hazards of mess and the hazards of order are quantifiable and that their costs can be measured in the same currency: time. Leaving something unsorted might be thought of as an act of procrastination—passing the buck to one’s future self, who’ll have to pay off with interest what we chose not to pay up front. But the whole story is subtler than that. Sometimes mess is more than just the easy choice. It’s the optimal choice.

One of the most familiar algorithms in sports is the Round-Robin format, where each of n teams eventually plays every one of the other n − 1 teams. While arguably the most comprehensive, it’s also one of the most laborious. Having every team grapple with every other team is like having guests exchange hugs at our dinner party: the dreaded O(n2), quadratic time.

Ladder tournaments—popular in sports like badminton, squash, and racquetball—put players in a linear ranking, with each player allowed to issue a direct challenge to the player immediately above them, exchanging places if they prevail. Ladders are the Bubble Sorts of the athletic world and are thus also quadratic, requiring O(n2) games to reach a stable ranking.

Computer scientists call this phenomenon noise. All of the sorting algorithms that we’ve considered thus far assume perfect, flawless, foolproof comparisons, ones that never mess up and mistakenly judge the lesser of two quantities to be the greater. Once you allow for a “noisy comparator,” some of computer science’s most hallowed algorithms go out the window—and some of its most maligned have their day of redemption.

But in fact it isn’t Bubble Sort that emerges as the single best algorithm in the face of a noisy comparator. The winner of that particular honor is an algorithm called Comparison Counting Sort. In this algorithm, each item is compared to all the others, generating a tally of how many items it is bigger than. This number can then be used directly as the item’s rank. Since it compares all pairs, Comparison Counting Sort is a quadratic-time algorithm, like Bubble Sort. Thus it’s not a popular choice in traditional computer science applications, but it’s exceptionally fault-tolerant.

Displacement happens when an animal uses its knowledge of the hierarchy to determine that a particular confrontation simply isn’t worth it. In many animal societies, resources and opportunities—food, mates, preferred spaces, and so forth—are scarce, and somehow it must be decided who gets what. Establishing an order ahead of time is less violent than coming to blows every time a mating opportunity or a prime spot of grass becomes available. Though we may cringe when we see creatures turning their claws and beaks on each other, biologists tend to think of pecking orders as the violence that preempts violence.

We’ve now seen two separate downsides to the desire of any group to sort itself. You have, at minimum, a linearithmic number of confrontations, making everyone’s life more combative as the group grows—and you also oblige every competitor to keep track of the ever-shifting status of everyone else, otherwise they’ll find themselves fighting battles they didn’t need to. It taxes not only the body but the mind.

It’s possible for the individuals to resent the basis of this hierarchy, but not really to contest its verdict. As a result, individual pairwise interactions take place with a minimum of jockeying for status.

Linearithmic numbers of fights might work fine for small-scale groups; they do in nature. But in a world where status is established through pairwise comparisons—whether they involve exchanging rhetoric or gunfire—the amount of confrontation quickly spirals out of control as society grows. Operating at industrial scale, with many thousands or millions of individuals sharing the same space, requires a leap beyond. A leap from ordinal to cardinal.

In an ideal world, they wrote, the machine would of course have limitless quantities of lightning-fast storage, but in practice this wasn’t possible. (It still isn’t.) Instead, the trio proposed what they believed to be the next best thing: “a hierarchy of memories, each of which has greater capacity than the preceding but which is less quickly accessible.” By having effectively a pyramid of different forms of memory—a small, fast memory and a large, slow one—maybe we could somehow get the best of both.

if you want to store anything else, and in computer science this making of room is called “cache replacement” or “cache eviction.” As Wilkes wrote, “Since the [cache] can only be a fraction of the size of the main memory, words cannot be preserved in it indefinitely, and there must be wired into the system an algorithm by which they are progressively overwritten.” These algorithms are known as “replacement policies” or “eviction policies,” or simply as caching algorithms.

As it explains, the goal of cache management is to minimize the number of times you can’t find what you’re looking for in the cache and must go to the slower main memory to find it; these are known as “page faults” or “cache misses.” The optimal cache eviction policy—essentially by definition, Bélády wrote—is, when the cache is full, to evict whichever item we’ll need again the longest from now.

The hypothetical all-knowing, prescient algorithm that would look ahead and execute the optimal policy is known today in tribute as Bélády’s Algorithm. Bélády’s Algorithm is an instance of what computer scientists call a “clairvoyant” algorithm: one informed by data from the future.

LRU teaches us that the next thing we can expect to need is the last one we needed, while the thing we’ll need after that is probably the second-most-recent one. And the last thing we can expect to need is the one we’ve already gone longest without. Unless we have good reason to think otherwise, it seems that our best guide to the future is a mirror image of the past. The nearest thing to clairvoyance is to assume that history repeats itself—backward.

The key idea behind Anderson’s new account of human memory is that the problem might be not one of storage, but of organization. According to his theory, the mind has essentially infinite capacity for memories, but we have only a finite amount of time in which to search for them. Anderson made the analogy to a library with a single, arbitrarily long shelf—the Noguchi Filing System at Library of Congress scale. You can fit as many items as you want on that shelf, but the closer something is to the front the faster it will be to find.

Recent work by a team of psychologists and linguists led by Michael Ramscar at the University of Tübingen has suggested that what we call “cognitive decline”—lags and retrieval errors—may not be about the search process slowing or deteriorating, but (at least partly) an unavoidable consequence of the amount of information we have to navigate getting bigger and bigger. Regardless of whatever other challenges aging brings, older brains—which must manage a greater store of memories—are literally solving harder computational problems with every passing day. The old can mock the young for their speed: “It’s because you don’t know anything yet!”

If you’re concerned with minimizing maximum lateness, then the best strategy is to start with the task due soonest and work your way toward the task due last. This strategy, known as Earliest Due Date, is fairly intuitive. (For instance, in a service-sector context, where each arriving patron’s “due date” is effectively the instant they walk in the door, it just means serving customers in order of arrival.)

Once JPL engineers had identified the Pathfinder problem as a case of priority inversion, they wrote up a fix and beamed the new code across millions of miles to Pathfinder. What was the solution they sent flying across the solar system? Priority inheritance. If a low-priority task is found to be blocking a high-priority resource, well, then all of a sudden that low-priority task should momentarily become the highest-priority thing on the system, “inheriting” the priority of the thing it’s blocking.

The comedian Mitch Hedberg recounts a time when “I was at a casino, I was minding my own business, and this guy came up and said, ‘You’re gonna have to move, you’re blocking the fire exit.’ As though if there was a fire, I wasn’t gonna run.” The bouncer’s argument was priority inversion; Hedberg’s rebuttal was priority inheritance. Hedberg lounging casually in front of a fleeing mob puts his low-priority loitering ahead of their high-priority running for their lives—but not if he inherits their priority. And an onrushing mob has a way of making one inherit their priority rather quickly. As Hedberg explains, “If you’re flammable and have legs, you are never blocking a fire exit.”

The drawing of the borders of scheduling theory continues to this day. A recent survey showed that the status of about 7% of all problems is still unknown, scheduling’s terra incognita. Of the 93% of the problems that we do understand, however, the news isn’t great: only 9% can be solved efficiently, and the other 84% have been proven intractable.

It offers a simple prescription for time management: each time a new piece of work comes in, divide its importance by the amount of time it will take to complete. If that figure is higher than for the task you’re currently doing, switch to the new one; otherwise stick with the current task. This algorithm is the closest thing that scheduling theory has to a skeleton key or Swiss Army knife, the optimal strategy not just for one flavor of problem but for many.

And the more you take on, the more overhead there is. At its nightmarish extreme, this turns into a phenomenon called thrashing.

Computers multitask through a process called “threading,” which you can think of as being like juggling a set of balls. Just as a juggler only hurls one ball at a time into the air but keeps three aloft, a CPU only works on one program at a time, but by swapping between them quickly enough (on the scale of ten-thousandths of a second) it appears to be playing a movie, navigating the web, and alerting you to incoming email all at once.

Think again about our image of a juggler. With one ball in the air, there’s enough spare time while that ball is aloft for the juggler to toss some others upward as well. But what if the juggler takes on one more ball than he can handle? He doesn’t drop that ball; he drops everything. The whole system, quite literally, goes down.

But if a task requires keeping track of so many things that they won’t all fit into memory, then you might well end up spending more time swapping information in and out of memory than doing the actual work. What’s more, when you switch tasks, the newly active task might make space for its working set by evicting portions of other working sets from memory. The next task, upon reactivation, would then reacquire parts of its working set from the hard disk and muscle them back into memory, again displacing others. This problem—tasks stealing space from each other—can get even worse in systems with hierarchies of caches between the processor and the memory.

At the extreme, a program may run just long enough to swap its needed items into memory, before giving way to another program that runs just long enough to overwrite them in turn. This is thrashing: a system running full-tilt and accomplishing nothing at all.

Part of what makes real-time scheduling so complex and interesting is that it is fundamentally a negotiation between two principles that aren’t fully compatible. These two principles are called responsiveness and throughput: how quickly you can respond to things, and how much you can get done overall.

Establishing a minimum amount of time to spend on any one task helps to prevent a commitment to responsiveness from obliterating throughput entirely: if the minimum slice is longer than the time it takes to context-switch, then the system can never get into a state where context switching is the only thing it’s doing. It’s also a principle that is easy to translate into a recommendation for human lives.

The moral is that you should try to stay on a single task as long as possible without decreasing your responsiveness below the minimum acceptable limit. Decide how responsive you need to be—and then, if you want to get things done, be no more responsive than that.

Bayes’s critical insight was that trying to use the winning and losing tickets we see to figure out the overall ticket pool that they came from is essentially reasoning backward. And to do that, he argued, we need to first reason forward from hypotheticals. In other words, we need to first determine how probable it is that we would have drawn the tickets we did if various scenarios were true. This probability—known to modern statisticians as the “likelihood”—gives us the information we need to solve the problem.

Laplace’s Law, and it is easy to apply in any situation where you need to assess the chances of an event based on its history. If you make ten attempts at something and five of them succeed, Laplace’s Law estimates your overall chances to be 6/12 or 50%, consistent with our intuitions. If you try only once and it works out, Laplace’s estimate of 2/3 is both more reasonable than assuming you’ll win every time, and more actionable than Price’s guidance (which would tell us that there is a 75% metaprobability of a 50% or greater chance of success).

And if we assume that we’re arriving precisely halfway into something’s duration, the best guess we can make for how long it will last into the future becomes obvious: exactly as long as it’s lasted already. Gott saw the Berlin Wall eight years after it was built, so his best guess was that it would stand for eight years more. (It ended up being twenty.) This straightforward reasoning, which Gott named the Copernican Principle, results in a simple algorithm that can be used to make predictions about all sorts of topics.

And if a municipal transit system cannot afford the incredibly useful but expensive real-time signs that tell riders when the next bus is going to arrive, the Copernican Principle suggests that there might be a dramatically simpler and cheaper alternative. Simply displaying how long it’s been since the previous bus arrived at that stop offers a substantial hint about when the next one will.

When Bayes’s Rule combines all these probabilities—the more-probable short time spans pushing down the average forecast, the less-probable yet still possible long ones pushing it up—the Copernican Principle emerges: if we want to predict how long something will last, and have no other knowledge about it whatsoever, the best guess we can make is that it will continue just as long as it’s gone on so far.

The Copernican Principle seems reasonable exactly in those situations where we know nothing at all—such as looking at the Berlin Wall in 1969, when we’re not even sure what timescale is appropriate. And it feels completely wrong in those cases where we do know something about the subject matter. Predicting that a 90-year-old man will live to 180 years seems unreasonable precisely because we go into the problem already knowing a lot about human life spans—and so we can do better.

This kind of pattern typifies what are called “power-law distributions.” These are also known as “scale-free distributions” because they characterize quantities that can plausibly range over many scales: a town can have tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of residents, so we can’t pin down a single value for how big a “normal” town should be.

And for any power-law distribution, Bayes’s Rule indicates that the appropriate prediction strategy is a Multiplicative Rule: multiply the quantity observed so far by some constant factor. For an uninformative prior, that constant factor happens to be 2, hence the Copernican prediction; in other power-law cases, the multiplier will depend on the exact distribution you’re working with. For the grosses of movies, for instance, it happens to be about 1.4. So if you hear a movie has made $6 million so far, you can guess it will make about $8.4 million overall; if it’s made $90 million, guess it will top out at $126 million. This multiplicative rule is a direct consequence of the fact that power-law distributions do not specify a natural scale for the phenomenon they’re describing. The only thing that gives us a sense of scale for our prediction, therefore, is the single data point we have—such as the fact that the Berlin Wall has stood for eight years. The larger the value

When we apply Bayes’s Rule with a normal distribution as a prior, on the other hand, we obtain a very different kind of guidance. Instead of a multiplicative rule, we get an Average Rule: use the distribution’s “natural” average—its single, specific scale—as your guide.

There’s a curious tension, then, between communicating with others and maintaining accurate priors about the world. When people talk about what interests them—and offer stories they think their listeners will find interesting—it skews the statistics of our experience. That makes it hard to maintain appropriate prior distributions.

So one of the deepest truths of machine learning is that, in fact, it’s not always better to use a more complex model, one that takes a greater number of factors into account. And the issue is not just that the extra factors might offer diminishing returns—performing better than a simpler model, but not enough to justify the added complexity. Rather, they might make our predictions dramatically worse.

So what do these complexity penalties look like? One algorithm, discovered in 1996 by biostatistician Robert Tibshirani, is called the Lasso and uses as its penalty the total weight of the different factors in the model.* By putting this downward pressure on the weights of the factors, the Lasso drives as many of them as possible completely to zero. Only the factors that have a big impact on the results remain in the equation—thus potentially transforming, say, an overfitted nine-factor model into a simpler, more robust formula

They asserted what’s now known as the Cobham–Edmonds thesis: an algorithm should be considered “efficient” if it runs in what’s called “polynomial time”—that is, O(n2), O(n3), or in fact n to the power of any number at all. A problem, in turn, is considered “tractable” if we know how to solve it using an efficient algorithm. A problem we don’t know how to solve in polynomial time, on the other hand, is considered “intractable.” And at anything but the smallest scales, intractable problems are beyond the reach of solution by computers, no matter how powerful.

One of the simplest forms of relaxation in computer science is known as Constraint Relaxation. In this technique, researchers remove some of the problem’s constraints and set about solving the problem they wish they had. Then, after they’ve made a certain amount of headway, they try to add the constraints back in. That is, they make the problem temporarily easier to handle before bringing it back to reality.

There are many ways to relax a problem, and we’ve seen three of the most important. The first, Constraint Relaxation, simply removes some constraints altogether and makes progress on a looser form of the problem before coming back to reality. The second, Continuous Relaxation, turns discrete or binary choices into continua: when deciding between iced tea and lemonade, first imagine a 50–50 “Arnold Palmer” blend and then round it up or down. The third, Lagrangian Relaxation, turns impossibilities into mere penalties, teaching the art of bending the rules (or breaking them and accepting the consequences). A rock band deciding which songs to cram into a limited set, for instance, is up against what computer scientists call the “knapsack problem”—a puzzle that asks one to decide which of a set of items of different bulk and importance to pack into a confined volume. In its strict formulation the knapsack problem is famously intractable, but that needn’t discourage our relaxed rock stars. As demonstrated in several celebrated examples, sometimes it’s better to simply play a bit past the city curfew and incur the related fines than to limit the show to the available slot. In fact, even when you don’t commit the infraction, simply imagining it can be illuminating.

Several decades after its discovery, it is still the standard method used to find and check primes in many domains. It’s working behind the scenes whenever you use your credit card online, and almost any time secure communications are sent through the air or over wires.

Here again randomness offers a way forward: just generate some random xs and plug them in. If the two expressions are not the same, it would be a big coincidence if they gave the same answer for some randomly generated input. And an even bigger coincidence if they also gave identical answers for a second random input. And a bigger coincidence still if they did it for three random inputs in a row. Since there is no known deterministic algorithm for efficiently testing polynomial identity, this randomized method—with multiple observations quickly giving rise to near-certainty—is the only practical one we

what if we only needed to be mostly sure this URL was new to us? That’s where the Bloom filter comes in. Named for its inventor, Burton H. Bloom, a Bloom filter works much like the Rabin-Miller primality test: the URL is entered into a set of equations that esssentially check for “witnesses” to its novelty. (Rather than proclaim “n is not prime,” these equations say “I have not seen n before.”) If you’re willing to tolerate an error rate of just 1% or 2%, storing your findings in a probabilistic data structure like a Bloom filter will save you significant amounts of both time and space. And the usefulness of such filters is not confined to search engines: Bloom filters have shipped with a number of recent web browsers to check URLs against a list of known malicious websites, and they are also an important part of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

But perhaps it’s just a case of a little knowledge being a dangerous thing. If the Dice Man had only had a deeper grasp of computer science, he’d have had some guidance. First, from Hill Climbing: even if you’re in the habit of sometimes acting on bad ideas, you should always act on good ones. Second, from the Metropolis Algorithm: your likelihood of following a bad idea should be inversely proportional to how bad an idea it is. Third, from Simulated Annealing: you should front-load randomness, rapidly cooling out of a totally random state, using ever less and less randomness as time goes on, lingering longest as you approach freezing.

What we now think of as “the Internet” is actually a collection of many protocols, but the chief among them (so much so that it’s often referred to more or less synonymously with the Internet) is what’s known as Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP. It was born from a 1973 talk and a 1974 paper by Vinton “Vint” Cerf and Robert “Bob” Kahn, who laid out a proposal for the language of—as they imagined calling it—an “internetwork.”

In circuit-switched networks, a call fails if any one of its links gets disrupted—which means that reliability goes down exponentially as a network grows larger. In packet switching, on the other hand, the proliferation of paths in a growing network becomes a virtue: there are now that many more ways for data to flow, so the reliability of the network increases exponentially with its size.

Computer scientists know this concept as the “Byzantine generals problem.” Imagine two generals, on opposite sides of a valley that contains their common enemy, attempting to coordinate an attack. Only by perfect synchronization will they succeed; for either to attack alone is suicide. What’s worse, any messages from one general to the other must be delivered by hand across the very terrain that contains the enemy, meaning there’s a chance that any given message will never arrive.

For this reason, phone services that automatically reduce background noise to silence are doing their users a major disservice.

Ironically, one of the few exceptions to this is in transmitting the human voice. Real-time voice communications, such as Skype, typically do not use TCP, which underlies most of the rest of the Internet. As researchers discovered in the early days of networking, using reliable, robust protocols—with all their ACKs and retransmission of lost packets—to transmit the human voice is overkill. The humans provide the robustness themselves. As Cerf explains, “In the case of voice, if you lose a packet, you just say, ‘Say that again, I missed something.’”

Beyond just collision avoidance, Exponential Backoff has become the default way of handling almost all cases of networking failure or unreliability. For instance, when your computer is trying to reach a website that appears to be down, it uses Exponential Backoff—trying again one second later, again a few seconds after that, and so forth. This is good for everyone: it prevents a host server that’s down from getting slammed with requests as soon as it comes back online, and it prevents your own machine from wasting too much effort trying to get blood from a stone.

The first efforts at computer networking focused on establishing reliable transmissions over unreliable links. These efforts proved to be so successful that a second concern immediately arose: making sure that an overloaded network could avoid catastrophic meltdown. No sooner had TCP solved the problem of getting data from point A to point B than it was confronted with the problem of gridlock.

Packet switching is radically different. The phone system gets full; the mail system gets slow. There’s nothing in the network to explicitly tell a sender how many other senders there are, or how congested the network is at any given moment, and the amount of congestion is constantly changing. Therefore, the sender and receiver must not only communicate but metacommunicate: they need to figure out how fast the data should be sent. Somehow, assorted packet flows—without explicit management or coordination—must both get out of each other’s way and quickly take advantage of any newly available space.

At the heart of TCP congestion control is an algorithm called Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease, or AIMD. Before AIMD kicks in, a new connection will ramp up its transmission rate aggressively: if the first packet is received successfully it sends out two more, if both of those get through it sends out a batch of four, and so on. But as soon as any packet’s ACK does not come back to the sender, the AIMD algorithm takes over. Under AIMD, any fully received batch of packets causes the number of packets in flight not to double but merely to increase by 1, and dropped packets cause the transmission rate to cut back by half (hence the name Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease). Essentially, AIMD takes the form of someone saying, “A little more, a little more, a little more, whoa, too much, cut way back, okay a little more, a little more…” Thus it leads to a characteristic bandwidth shape known as the “TCP sawtooth”—steady upward climbs punctuated by steep drops.

The so-called Cravath System, devised by leading law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, involves hiring almost exclusively recent graduates, placing them into the bottom ranks, and then routinely either promoting or firing them over the following years. In 1980, the US Armed Forces adopted a similar “up or out” policy with the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act. The United Kingdom has likewise pursued what they call “manning control,” to great controversy.

Laurence J. Peter saw it, the insidious Peter Principle arises in corporations because of “the first commandment of hierarchical life: the hierarchy must be preserved.” TCP, in contrast, teaches the virtues of flexibility. Companies speak of “flat” hierarchies and “tall” hierarchies, but they might consider speaking of dynamic ones. Under an AIMD system, no one is long anxious about being overtaxed, nor long resentful about a missed promotion; both are temporary and frequent correctives, and the system hovers near its equilibrium despite everything changing all the time. Perhaps one day we’ll speak not of the arc of one’s career, but rather of its sawtooth.

As linguist Victor Yngve would write in 1970, “In fact, both the person who has the turn and his partner are simultaneously engaged in both speaking and listening. This is because of the existence of what I call the back channel, over which the person who has the turn receives short messages such as ‘yes’ and ‘uh-huh’ without relinquishing the turn.”

A buffer is essentially a queue whose function is to smooth out bursts. If you walked into a doughnut shop at roughly the same time as another customer, it wouldn’t do for the very momentarily overwhelmed cashier to make one of you leave the store and come back another time. Customers wouldn’t have it, of course, but neither would management: such a policy is virtually guaranteed to underutilize the cashier. Putting the customers in a queue instead ensures that the average throughput of the store approaches its maximum throughput. That’s a good thing.

When a networking buffer fills up, what typically happens is called Tail Drop: an unceremonious way of saying that every packet arriving after that point is simply rejected, and effectively deleted.

Mathematicians analyzing these games seek to identify a so-called equilibrium: that is, a set of strategies that both players can follow such that neither player would want to change their own play, given the play of their opponent. It’s called an equilibrium because it’s stable—no amount of further reflection by either player will bring them to different choices. I’m content with my strategy, given yours, and you’re content with your strategy, given mine.

In a game-theory context, knowing that an equilibrium exists doesn’t actually tell us what it is—or how to get there.

Even when we can reach an equilibrium, just because it’s stable doesn’t make it good. It may seem paradoxical, but the equilibrium strategy—where neither player is willing to change tack—is by no means necessarily the strategy that leads to the best outcomes for the players. Nowhere is that better illustrated than in game theory’s most famous, provocative, and controversial two-player game: “the prisoner’s dilemma.”

But from a congestion standpoint, the fact that anarchy is only 4/3 as congested as perfect coordination means that perfectly coordinated commutes will only be 3/4 as congested as they are now. It’s a bit like the famous line by James Branch Cabell: “The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds; and the pessimist fears this is true.” Congestion will always be a problem solvable more by planners and by overall demand than by the decisions of individual drivers, human or computer, selfish or cooperative.

In theory, all the villagers should graze only as many animals as would leave some grass for everyone. In practice, though, the benefits of grazing a little bit more than that accrue directly to you, while the harms seem too small to be of consequence. Yet if everyone follows this logic of using just slightly more of the commons than they should, a dreadful equilibrium results: a completely devastated lawn, and no grass for anyone’s livestock thereafter.

Imagine two shopkeepers in a small town. Each of them can choose either to stay open seven days a week or to be open only six days a week, taking Sunday off to relax with their friends and family. If both of them take a day off, they’ll retain their existing market share and experience less stress. However, if one shopkeeper decides to open his shop seven days a week, he’ll draw extra customers—taking them away from his competitor and threatening his livelihood. The Nash equilibrium, again, is for everyone to work all the time.

For the small-town shopkeepers, a verbal truce to take Sundays off would be unstable: as soon as either shopkeeper needed some extra cash he’d be liable to violate it, prompting the other to start working Sundays as well so as not to lose market share. This would land them right back in the bad equilibrium where they get the worst of both worlds—they’re exhausted and don’t get any competitive advantage for it. But they might be able to act as their own don by signing a legally binding contract to the effect that, say, any proceeds earned by either shop on a Sunday go to the other shop. By worsening the unsatisfactory equilibrium, they’d make a new and better one.

Scaling up this logic results in a potent argument for the role of government. In fact, many governments do have laws on the books mandating minimum vacations and limiting shop hours. And while the United States is one of the only developed nations without federal requirements for paid vacation, Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island do have state-level prohibitions on Thanksgiving commerce.

If the forest could only somehow agree to a kind of truce, the ecosystem could enjoy the photosynthetic bounty without the wood-making arms race wasting it all. But as we’ve seen, good outcomes in these scenarios tend only to arise in the context of an authority outside the game—someone changing the payoffs from the top down. It would seem as though in nature, then, there is simply no way of establishing good equilibria between individuals.

As Cornell economist Robert Frank puts it, “If people expect us to respond irrationally to the theft of our property, we will seldom need to, because it will not be in their interests to steal it. Being predisposed to respond irrationally serves much better here than being guided only by material self-interest.”

Yes, people search for objective characteristics they care about. Everybody wants somebody who’s kind and intelligent and interesting and healthy and maybe physically attractive, good earning power, the whole laundry list of features, but that’s the first pass.… After you’ve spent enough time together, it’s not those things that make you want to stay together. It’s just the fact that it’s that particular person—that is what’s valuable to you, so you don’t really need the contract so much as you need a feeling that makes you not want to separate, even though objectively there might be a better option available to you.

Another classic auction format, the “Dutch auction” or “descending auction,” gradually lowers an item’s price until someone is willing to buy it. The name references the Aalsmeer Flower Auction, the largest flower auction in the world, which takes place daily in the Netherlands—but Dutch auctions are more prevalent than they might initially seem.

Just as with the tragedy of the commons, this failure is not necessarily the players’ fault. An enormously influential paper by the economists Sushil Bikhchandani, David Hirshleifer, and Ivo Welch has demonstrated that under the right circumstances, a group of agents who are all behaving perfectly rationally and perfectly appropriately can nonetheless fall prey to what is effectively infinite misinformation. This has come to be known as an “information cascade.”

For one, be wary of cases where public information seems to exceed private information, where you know more about what people are doing than why they’re doing it, where you’re more concerned with your judgments fitting the consensus than fitting the facts. When you’re mostly looking to others to set a course, they may well be looking right back at you to do the same.

Second, remember that actions are not beliefs; cascades get caused in part when we misinterpret what others think based on what they do. We should be especially hesitant to overrule our own doubts—and if we do, we might want to find some way to broadcast those doubts even as we move forward, lest others fail to distinguish the reluctance in our minds from the implied enthusiasm in our actions.

Named for Nobel Prize–winning economist William Vickrey, the Vickrey auction, just like the first-price auction, is a “sealed bid” auction process. That is, every participant simply writes down a single number in secret, and the highest bidder wins. However, in a Vickrey auction, the winner ends up paying not the amount of their own bid, but that of the second-place bidder. That is to say, if you bid $25 and I bid $10, you win the item at my price: you only have to pay $10.

In fact, a game-theoretic principle called “revenue equivalence” establishes that over time, the average expected sale price in a first-price auction will converge to precisely the same as in a Vickrey auction. Thus the Vickrey equilibrium involves the same bidder winning the item for the same price—without any strategizing by any of the bidders whatsoever. As Tim Roughgarden tells his Stanford students, the Vickrey auction is “awesome.”

Binmore adds another insight: games like the prisoner’s dilemma seemingly obliterate Immanuel Kant’s argument that rationality consists of what he called the “categorical imperative,” acting the way you wish everyone else would act. The categorical imperative would give us a better outcome in the prisoner’s dilemma than the equilibrium strategy, but there’s no getting around the fact that this outcome isn’t a stable one.

Man is by nature a social animal; an individual who is unsocial naturally and not accidentally is either beneath our notice or more than human. Society is something in nature that precedes the individual. Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god. Aristotle Politics, c. 328 BC

As one writer described it, “The peasant stank as did the priest, the apprentice as did his master’s wife; the whole of the aristocracy stank, even the king himself stank, stank like a rank lion and the queen like an old goat, summer and winter.”

That’s why most of us are cognitive misers: We seek ways to conserve cognitive (mental) energy and simplify complexity. We take shortcuts and use rules of thumb. We ignore some information to reduce our cognitive load; we overuse other information to keep from having to search for more; or we just go with our initial intuitions and accept a less-than-perfect alternative because it is good enough.

In the 1800s, the brain was compared to a telegraph and in the 1900s to a telephone switchboard. With the advent of computers, psychologists began to describe the functions of the mind as being comparable to a Mac or PC. Just like a computer, the human brain is said to store and retrieve memories; departures from rational thinking are often described as “bugs” in an operating system, or the result of our “limited processing capacity,” or a reduction in “cognitive bandwidth” due to stress.

This extreme, you-can-become-anything view of human malleability lingers in today’s society, but it has faded among psychologists in light of the scientific evidence on genetic predispositions. Identical twins who are separated at birth and raised in different families nonetheless reveal a striking similarity in mannerisms, behavior, habits, attitudes — even political views; and siblings who grow up in the same family do not become more alike in personality.

Group life confers tremendous advantages, like food sharing and protection, but it also imposes cognitive challenges, like learning and remembering important information about members of a group — who is apt to steal your food or your mate. It takes a big brain to house all the information about other group members and the variety of ways they act. That’s why, when tribes of hunter-gatherers grew larger than 150 members or so, group life became more difficult and stressful, and the tribes tended to splinter into smaller ones.

A characteristic one is the bias blind spot, the belief that we are more objective and less biased than most other people. We are biased to think we aren’t biased! This blind spot arises from the fact that many of our beliefs operate implicitly, hidden beneath conscious awareness. When we see our own behavior, we know the context and can make excuses for it; we know what we feel, after all. But when we see others’ behavior, we miss the full context. That’s why it is easy to see hypocrisy in others but not in ourselves.

Automatic processing refers to the unconscious (implicit) and involuntary operations that guide most of our behavior: well-learned associations or routines that our mental systems perform effortlessly, without awareness. This is the kind of thinking that animal brains have been doing for half a billion years — fast, efficient responses to sensory input.

Controlled processing, by contrast, is the conscious (explicit) effort we make in dealing with novel problems, such as learning to drive, solving complex math problems, trying to remember the name of a movie, or answering a question like “Why do you love your boyfriend?” This kind of thinking is evolutionarily more recent, and it is tied to the development of language. It is slower and sequential — we process one thought after another rather than several in parallel.

Most decisions involve a two-step process. Our automatic system first produces a quick-and-dirty assessment of reality — an intuition, a feeling, an unthinking preference. Then, if we are motivated and if we have access to valid information, we use more controlled or deliberate thinking to modify the initial impressions.

Moreover, unlike automatic processing, controlled processing cannot do two things at once. This is why so many studies have shown that, despite what you egocentrically believe about your own abilities, it is impossible to multitask effectively.

Human beings are usually pretty proud of our controlled-processing skills, but Jonathan Haidt33 estimates that our conscious reasoning — “the stream of words and images of which we are fully aware” — represents only about 1 percent of our thinking. The other 99 percent occurs outside of awareness, but that’s the percentage, he argues, that actually governs most of our behavior.

People frequently see faces in unlikely places: on the surface of the moon, on potato chips, on a slice of toast, or famously, on a cinnamon bun, which showed the alleged face of Mother Teresa. We connect random stimuli into meaningful patterns, and much of the time those patterns involve people, most likely because people are on our minds.

Where does your mind go when it goes wandering? Where is it wandering to? What do you think about when you are “off task”? The default mode network is a set of interacting brain regions that are active when not directed to a task or focused on the outside world. This network is also active when we’re explicitly thinking about people. That is why, when our minds wander, they typically wander to social matters: plans we’re making with friends, memories of loved ones, conflicts with a partner, sexual fantasies about all kinds of people, or problems caused by other people. We see human stories in everything because people are never far from our thoughts.

once we divide people into groups, our minds automatically lead us to exaggerate the differences between us and them, rather than notice similarities. Whereas we tend to see people in our group — the ingroup — as a collection of unique individuals, we tend to see those in the outgroup as more alike — “they’re all the same,” people often say, or “they all look alike to me.”

In fact, “they” often do look alike. That is a common perceptual glitch: white people who evaluate a photo array of faces will have more trouble distinguishing them from one another if the faces are Asian or black than if they are white.

We are also far more charitable in judging members of our own group than when judging “them.” We not only see people in our group as being more varied; we see our group as being better and more deserving.

A threatened or diminished sense of belonging also changes the way people process and interpret information, at once making them more open to interaction with others but also more cautious of rejection — and thus hypersensitive to other people’s behavior.55 It’s as if they say to themselves, “I really want to be accepted by this group, but I’ll keep an eagle eye out for signs they don’t want me.”

Arie Kruglanski, an expert on terrorism, has found several commonalities among terrorists, and three central motives stand out.63 First, they have an intense desire to belong, to be part of a larger group that provides them with an identity and purpose. Second, they have a high need for certainty, order, and structure; the black-and-white dogma of fundamentalist groups provides them with clear answers — with the certainty they crave in an uncertain world. Third, belonging to a terrorist group resolves their feeling that their lives are trivial and meaningless; it provides them with significance, an intense feeling that their lives matter.

The term fundamental attribution error refers to a human tendency to overestimate the importance of personality or dispositional factors relative to situational or environmental influences when describing and explaining why people do what they do.

The fundamental attribution error has consequences in our personal, romantic lives, too. If your partner does something thoughtless, for example, you could make a dispositional attribution (“My partner is an inconsiderate slob; we need to break up”) or a situational attribution (“My partner must be under incredible pressure at work; we need a vacation”). Guess which attribution leads to happier relationships?

I am not saying that criminals shouldn’t be held accountable for their actions. And I am definitely not saying that dispositional factors such as laziness, heartlessness, or viciousness don’t exist. They do! But focusing on personal rather than situational factors will result in different policies for reducing poverty and crime. The attribution “this criminal is inherently evil” will lead us to support policies of spending more money on prisons and doling out longer, crueler prison sentences.

the Self-Fulfilling Prophecy Of all the attributions we make, those about success and failure are among the most important, because they affect our sense of control. When children have trouble in school or fail their tests, the explanations they tell themselves and others about the reasons will determine whether they continue to fail — or eventually succeed.

The mechanism creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, which occurs when we act on our initial attribution of our behavior and then behave in a way to confirm it: “I failed that test, so I’m stupid. Therefore I won’t study. Therefore, I will fail. See? I told you I was stupid.”

This effect was primarily found in first and second grades, which suggests that children are particularly susceptible to their teachers’ expectations of them when they are new to school and their academic self-concepts are still forming. In later grades, the score differences were smaller or nonexistent. However, for students belonging to minority groups, the impact of teacher expectations was larger and spanned more grades, suggesting that minority status leaves children especially sensitive to the way their teachers treat them.

Let’s say there are four merlots, at $14, $35, $70, and $170 per bottle. Although the restaurant may not sell much of the $170 wine, its existence makes the other wines look cheaper by comparison. And because most people don’t want to appear cheap by ordering the least expensive bottle on the list, the strategic placement of the outrageously pricey decoy allows the restaurant to jack up the price of the second- and third-cheapest bottles, charging you a good deal more than they are worth.

On the contrary, remembering is a reconstructive process. Our memories are most strongly influenced not by what actually happened in the past but by what we are thinking about those events in the present. We recreate our memories from bits and pieces of actual events filtered through and modified by our notions of what might have been, what should have been, or the way we would like things to have been.

Festinger described cognitive dissonance as a state of tension that occurs when an individual simultaneously holds two cognitions (ideas, attitudes, beliefs, opinions) that are psychologically inconsistent. Two cognitions are dissonant if the opposite of one follows from the other.

Because the experience of cognitive dissonance is unpleasant, people are motivated to reduce it; this is analogous to the processes involved in reducing such drives as hunger or thirst — except that, here, the driving force arises from cognitive discomfort rather than physiological need.

How do we convince ourselves that our lives are not absurd? That is, how do we reduce cognitive dissonance? We do this by changing one or both cognitions in such a way as to render them more compatible (more consonant) with each other or by adding more cognitions that help bridge the gap between the original cognitions.

But what if you are one of the top executives of a major cigarette company and therefore in a situation of maximum commitment to the sales of cigarettes all over the world. If it is true that cigarette smoking causes cancer, then in a sense, you are partially responsible for the illness and death of millions of people. This realization would produce a painful degree of dissonance. Your cognition “I am a decent, kind human being” would be dissonant with your cognition “I am contributing to the early death of millions of people.” To reduce this dissonance, you must try to convince yourself that cigarette smoking is safe — not an easy task given that you are frequently confronted with anti-smoking rhetoric and accusations that you are evil. You must also refute the mountain of scientific evidence documenting a link between cigarettes and disease. Moreover, to bolster your disbelief in the evidence, you might smoke a pack or two a day yourself. If your need is great enough, you might even succeed in convincing yourself that cigarettes are good for people. Thus, to see yourself as wise, good, and right, you take action that is stupid, wrong, and detrimental to your own health.

Drew Westen and his colleagues24 found that the reasoning areas of the brain virtually shut down when a person is confronted with dissonant information and the emotion circuits of the brain light up happily when consonance is restored. As Westen put it, people twirl the “cognitive kaleidoscope” until the pieces fall into the pattern they want to see, and then the brain repays them by activating circuits involved in pleasure. It seems that the feeling of cognitive dissonance can literally make your brain hurt.

A key characteristic of the examples we have discussed is the relative irrevocability of the decision — the person’s inability to undo it

Again, once a decision is irrevocable, people get busy making themselves feel good about the choice they made. And thus, they frequently become more certain that they have made a wise decision once there is nothing they can do about it.

lowballing: an unscrupulous strategy in which a customer agrees to purchase a product at a very low cost, after which the salesperson claims that price was an error and then raises the price, betting that the customer will agree to make the purchase at the inflated price, which he or she often does

What is going on in this situation? There are at least three important things to notice. First, while the customer’s decision to buy is certainly reversible, there is an implicit commitment created by the act of signing a check for a down payment. Second, this commitment triggered the anticipation of a pleasant experience: driving out with a new car. To have the anticipated event thwarted (by not going ahead with the deal) would have produced dissonance and disappointment. Third, although the final price is higher than the salesman said it would be, it is only slightly higher than the price somewhere else. Under these circumstances, the customer says, in effect, “Oh, what the hell. I’m already here; I’ve already filled out the forms — why wait?”

In this instance, the most efficient way to reduce dissonance would be to change your attitude about cheating. If you cheat, you will adopt a more lenient attitude. Your reasoning might go something like this: “Cheating isn’t so bad under some circumstances. As long as nobody gets hurt, it’s really not very immoral. Anybody would do it. Therefore, it’s a part of human nature — so how could it be bad? Since it is only human, those who get caught cheating should not be severely punished but should be treated with understanding.”

The minute you take a step in one direction or the other, however, you will feel dissonance — and now you will be motivated to justify what you did to reduce it. That justification, in turn, makes it harder for you to change your mind, even when you should. By the time you are at the bottom of the pyramid, you will be very far apart from those who faced the same dilemmas but who made a different decision and stepped off the pyramid in the opposite direction. And you will have convinced yourself that your decision was absolutely, positively the right one, and that those people who slid down on the other side are idiots or crooks. (And how do you think they feel about you?)

The pyramid metaphor is also useful in helping us understand how attitudes and behavior can change through the process of entrapment, or how people can start off making a small, impulsive decision and, over time, find themselves a long way from their original goals and intentions.

One possibility is to get the person involved in a much smaller aspect of the job, one so easy that he or she wouldn’t dream of turning it down. This action serves to commit the individual to “the cause.” Once people are thus committed, the likelihood of their complying with the larger request increases.

But what happens if there is not ample justification in the situation itself? In such cases we need to create internal justification, a change in attitude used to justify behavior. If you do or say something that is difficult to justify externally, you will attempt to justify it internally by making your attitudes more consistent with what you did or said.

Thus, dissonance theory predicts that we begin to believe the things we say — but only if we don’t have enough external justification for saying them. The smaller the bribe used to get you to give a speech, the more likely it is that you will feel the need to justify delivering it by convincing yourself that the things you said were true.

Monetary gain or a forced requirement to do something is not the only form of external justification. People can be persuaded to say or do things that contradict their beliefs or preferences if they are enticed by other rewards, such as praise or the desire to please. Furthermore, most of us would probably agree to do something that we otherwise wouldn’t do if a good friend asked us to do it as a favor.

The child in the mild-threat situation feels dissonance, too. But when he asks himself, “How come I’m not beating up my little sister?” he doesn’t have a good answer because the threat is so mild that it does not provide abundant justification. The child isn’t doing something he wants to do — and while he does have some justification for not doing it, he lacks complete justification. In this situation, he continues to experience dissonance, but he can’t reduce it by simply blaming his inaction on a severe threat. The child must find a way to justify the fact that he is not aggressing against his little sister, and the best way is to try to convince himself that he really doesn’t like to beat his sister up, that he didn’t want to do it in the first place, and that beating up little kids isn’t fun anyway.

In fact, Mills included this refinement in his experiment, and his results supported the hypothesis: Those who cheated to obtain a small reward tended to soften their attitude about cheating more than those who cheated to obtain a large reward. Moreover, those who refrained from cheating in spite of the temptation of a large reward — a choice that would create a lot of dissonance — hardened their attitude about cheating to a greater extent than those who refrained in the face of a small reward. This was just as predicted.

By and large, if you want someone to do something just once (or refrain from doing it), while you are standing there watching them, then by all means provide them with the largest incentive (or the most severe punishment) you can deliver. If you offer that person a million dollars to say that the North Korean dictator is a great humanitarian, or if you put a gun to their head and threaten to pull the trigger six times, chances are that person will say what you want — but they won’t believe it. But if you want that person to develop a set of values or beliefs that they will act on even when you aren’t there, then offer the person the smallest award that will bring about the behavior you want. That gets them to do the work of persuading themselves, which ensures that they will continue to do those things (or refrain from doing those things) for years after you have left the room.

Who do you think feels the greatest dissonance after doing something cruel, foolish, or incompetent: a person with high self-esteem or low self-esteem? The answer is the people with the highest self-esteem. They experience the most dissonance when they behave in ways that are contrary to their high opinion of themselves, and they will work harder to reduce it than will those with average levels of self-esteem.

One condition, however, limits the justification of cruelty: the capacity of the victim to retaliate. If the victim is able and willing to retaliate at some future time, then a harm-doer feels that equity will be restored and thus has no need to justify the action by denigrating the victim.

This research has serious implications: It shows that people do not perform acts of cruelty and come out unscathed. When we are engaged in a war in which, through our actions, many innocent people are being killed, we might try to blame the victims to justify our complicity — especially civilian victims who can’t retaliate. A sad, though universal, phenomenon is that all cultures are inclined to dehumanize their enemies by calling them cruel names and regarding them as “vermin,” “animals,” “brutes,” and other nonhuman creatures.

Dissonance theory suggests that if scientists want to motivate people into taking immediate action on global warming, it will be vital to also convince them that doing something about it is within their control. Simply stoking up their fears is likely to make them either deny its existence or actively disregard the scientific evidence.

How can a leader avoid falling into the self-justification trap? Historical examples show us that the way out of this process is for a leader to bring in skilled advisors from outside his or her inner circle, because the advisors will not be caught up in the need to reduce the dissonance created by the leader’s earlier decisions.

That’s why, when people are forced to apologize, what they say usually rings hollow: “If I offended anyone …” Of course you did! That’s why we want you to apologize!

I can increase the probability of being able to do this in the following ways: Through a greater understanding of my own defensiveness and dissonance-reducing tendencies. Through the realization that doing something foolish, immoral, or hurtful does not necessarily mean that I am an irrevocably foolish, immoral, or cruel person; cheating on one occasion doesn’t inevitably make me a “cheater,” unless I keep justifying what I did. Through the development of enough ego strength to acknowledge and learn from errors in myself.

One is nicely illustrated by this contrast in folk wisdom: In America, people say, “The squeaky wheel gets the grease” (meaning, “Speak up! Be heard!”); in Japan they say, “The nail that sticks up gets pounded down” (meaning, “Don’t deviate from your group”). In their analysis of 133 experiments using the Asch procedure in 17 different countries, Rod Bond and Peter Smith22 found that conformity is more prevalent in collectivist societies, which explicitly value group harmony (like Japan and China), than in individualistic societies (like the United States and France).

Another reason, besides conformity, that bystanders may fail to intervene is the diffusion of responsibility: Even if people conclude that the event is a genuine emergency, the awareness of other witnesses diffuses the responsibility felt by any one person.

What conditions make apathy or altruism more likely? The sense of a “common fate” is clearly activated, and they are in face-to-face situations with victims. When these conditions are lacking, individuals make a quick, often unconscious assessment of whether or not they should get involved: Is the situation really serious? Does it require my personal intervention? Will helping be difficult or costly for me? Will my help benefit the victim? Can I easily leave? Your response to the situation will depend on your answers to each of these questions.

The term identification describes a level of conformity brought about by an individual’s desire to be like the group or role model they admire. In identification, as in compliance, we do not behave in a particular way because such behavior is intrinsically satisfying; rather, we do it because it puts us in a satisfying relationship with the person or persons with whom we are identifying

In contrast, the peripheral route to persuasion is less direct; rather than weighing and considering the strength of arguments, the person responds to simple, often irrelevant cues that suggest the rightness, wrongness, or attractiveness of an argument without giving it much thought.

To summarize, communicators who are most likely to influence us are those we regard as being both expert and trustworthy. That said, their trustworthiness and effectiveness can be increased if: they take a position that seems opposed to their self-interest. they do not seem to be trying to influence our opinion. they are especially attractive and appealing — at least where our opinions and not our deep-seated attitudes are concerned. they are confident in their assertions, because confidence increases their credibility, unless we have reasons to doubt their motives.

Communications themselves differ, and how they differ can determine their effectiveness. Here I want to consider five dimensions along which they vary: (1) Is a communication more persuasive if it is designed to appeal to the audience’s reasoning ability or if it is aimed at arousing the audience’s emotions? (2) Are people more swayed by a communication if it is tied to a compelling personal experience or if it is bolstered by a stack of unimpeachable statistical evidence? (3) Does the communication resonate with the audience’s way of seeing themselves, that is, with their basic identity? (4) Should the communication present only one side of the argument or should it also present the opposing view? (5) What is the relationship between the effectiveness of the communication and the discrepancy between the audience’s original opinion and the opinion advocated by the communication?

On the one hand, it suggests that a good scare will motivate people to act; on the other hand, it argues that too much fear can interfere with a person’s ability to pay attention to the message, to comprehend it, and to act upon it. We’ve all believed, at one time or another, that “it only happens to the other guy — it can’t happen to me.” That’s why some people continue to drive and text or to insist on driving after they’ve had a few drinks, even though they know better. Perhaps this is because the risks of accidents are so alarming that people put them out of their minds. Thus we might predict that if a communication really frightens us, we tend not to pay close attention to it. What does the evidence tell us? The

Is this true for everyone? It is not. There is a reason why common sense suggests that fear blocks us from acting: It does — for certain people, under certain conditions. What “certain people,” for example? Leventhal and his colleagues discovered that people who had a high opinion of themselves were most likely to be motivated to take immediate action when they were frightened.

Daniel Gilbert67 suggests that part of the answer lies in the way our brains work. Our brains evolved to be frightened — and riled to action — by threats of clear and present dangers (like tigers, snakes, or enemies carrying weapons), not gradual ones that might happen later (like droughts, influenza, or more frequent hurricanes).

Moral emotions can be highly persuasive rhetorical devices — they tend to inspire action and unite like-minded communities — and they tend to be contagious.69 For example, on Twitter, tweets that contain words associated with moral emotions (such as outrageous or disgusting or bad) tend to be re-tweeted more often than non-moral emotion words.

Most politicians are well aware of this phenomenon, which is why they tend to present vastly different kinds of speeches, depending upon the audience. When talking to the party faithful, they almost invariably deliver a hell-raising set of arguments favoring their own party platform and candidacy. If they do mention the opposition, it is in a derisive, mocking tone. But when they are appearing on television or speaking to an audience of mixed loyalties, they tend to take a more diplomatic position, giving the opposing view a reasonably accurate airing before proceeding to demolish it.

As a result of such evidence, some evolutionary psychologists maintain that ideological belief systems may have evolved in human societies to be organized along a left–right dimension, consisting of two core sets of attitudes: (1) whether a person advocates social change or supports the system as it is, and (2) whether a person thinks inequality is a result of human policies and can be overcome or is inevitable and should be accepted as part of the natural order.

According to Jack Brehm’s theory of reactance,95 when our sense of freedom is threatened, we attempt to restore it. Have you ever been warned sternly not to do something — “Don’t touch this hot plate! Don’t go out with that person! Don’t smoke grass!” — and then promptly did it anyway? That’s reactance. When people think that someone’s message is too blatant or coercive, thereby intruding on their freedom of choice, they likely activate their defenses to resist it.

The person who is easiest to brainwash is the person whose beliefs are based on slogans that have never been seriously challenged. For me, the upshot of this research is that having our ideas challenged can have great benefits — either by convincing us that some of our cherished beliefs might be wrong, or by forcing us to think about the reasons for our beliefs and understand those reasons on a deeper level than we had ever done before.

Hobbes’s more pessimistic view was elaborated in the twentieth century by Sigmund Freud,3 who theorized that human beings are born with an instinctual drive toward life, which he called eros, and an instinctual drive toward death, thanatos, leading to aggressive actions. About the death instinct, Freud wrote, “It is at work in every living being and is striving to bring it to ruin and to reduce life to its original condition of inanimate matter.”

Whereas the chimpanzee will act aggressively with little provocation, the bonobo is one of the least aggressive species on the planet. In fact, bonobos have been called the “make love not war” ape, because whenever a potentially dangerous conflict looms, bonobos have sex, which defuses tension. (They will have sex after a conflict, too, to make up.)

The research on cultures of honor suggests that male aggression (“Don’t mess with me”) is encouraged when it fulfills a central part of the male role and identity.

That belief stems from the psychoanalytic concept of catharsis, or the release of energy. Sigmund Freud believed that aggressive energy must come out somehow, lest it continue to build up and produce illness. His theory rested on the analogy of water pressure building up in a container: Unless aggression is allowed to drain off, it will produce an explosion.

The message is clear: Physical activity — like punching a punching bag or playing an aggressive sport — neither dissipates anger nor reduces subsequent aggression against the person who provoked it. In fact, the data lead us in precisely the opposite direction: The more that people ventilate anger by behaving aggressively, the angrier they remain and the more aggressive they become. Venting anger — directly or indirectly, verbally or physically — does not reduce hostility; it increases it.

Intoxicated people often focus upon and respond to the earliest and most obvious aspects of a social situation and tend to miss the subtleties. That means, in practical terms, that if you are sober and someone accidentally steps on your toe, chances are you would know the person didn’t do it on purpose. But if you were drunk, you might miss the subtle cues and respond as if he stomped on your foot with full intent.

These factors help draw the important distinction between frustration and deprivation. Children who don’t have toys (and monkeys who don’t have grapes) do not necessarily become angry or aggressive. Rather, as the toy experiment indicates, it was those children who had every reason to expect to play with the toys who felt frustrated when that expectancy was thwarted; this thwarted hope was what caused the children to behave destructively.

Let us assume the amount of pressure and pain is exactly the same in both cases (and that you haven’t been drinking!). My guess is that the latter situation would evoke an aggressive response, but the former would produce little or no aggression.

Anonymity induces deindividuation, a state of lessened self-awareness, reduced concern about what other people think of them, and weakened restraints against prohibited forms of behavior. When we are made self-aware, we tend to uphold our own values (e.g., “Thou shalt not harm”); when we are anonymous and not self-aware, we tend to act more on impulse.

Watching violence seems to have effects on vulnerable viewers for five reasons: (1) it increases physiological arousal (“I guess I’m really angry rather than stressed”); (2) it triggers a tendency to imitate the hostile or violent characters, weakening previously learned inhibitions (“If they can do it, so can I”); (3) it triggers underlying feelings of anger, fear, or frustration (“I’d better get him before he gets me!”); (4) it promotes psychological numbing and reduces empathy (“Ho hum, another beating — what else is on?”); and (5) it often models approved ways of behaving when we are frustrated, angry, or hurt (“Oh, so that’s how you do it!”).

This may be why sexual violence is more likely to be committed by high-status men, including sports heroes (professional, college, and high school athletic stars), powerful politicians, and celebrities, who could easily find consenting partners.

Sexual scripts vary according to one’s culture, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, and geographic region, and they change over time. These scripts shape what women and men learn is the “right” way to be sexual and popular, primarily from observations of role models, peers, and media images and messages. Who gets to ask whom out? How many dates before sex is expected? What kind of sex? Who initiates? Is any kind of sex before marriage permitted, discouraged, or forbidden?

Because the world is too complicated for us to have a highly differentiated attitude about everything and everyone, we develop elegant, accurate narratives about our own group and all of the variations we see in people who belong to it, while relying on simple, sketchy ideas about other groups.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, stereotypes are often accurate, and as such can be an adaptive, shorthand way of dealing with complexity.16 Indeed, as Lee Jussim and his colleagues have shown,17 the accuracy of stereotypes turns out to be among the strongest and most reliable findings in social psychology, despite the frequent assumption that they always lead us astray.

A valid justification for disliking a group enables us to express prejudice without feeling like bigots — thus avoiding the cognitive dissonance that would be created by “I’m a fair, just, unprejudiced person” and “But I really dislike those people.”

Frequently, however, the cause of a person’s frustration is either too big or too vague for direct retaliation. For example, if a 6-year-old boy is humiliated by his teacher, how can he fight back? The teacher has too much power. But this frustration may increase the probability of his aggressing against a less powerful bystander — even if the bystander had nothing to do with his humiliation. By the same token, if there is mass unemployment, who is the frustrated, unemployed worker going to strike out against, the economic system? The system is much too big and much too impersonal. Accordingly, the unemployed worker might try to find a person or group to blame.

“No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion,” Mandela wrote. “People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love. For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.”

I turn now to five consistent factors that have a profound influence on our choice of friends and lovers: We tend to like people who live in close proximity to us; who we think are similar to us; who like us; and who are physically attractive. And to these I will add a relatively recent phenomenon created by our high-tech world, one that profoundly affects whom we like, whom we choose, and whether we stay: It’s called the paradox of choice.

Moreover, we humans are so certain of the relationship between attitude similarity and liking that if we happen to like someone for some irrelevant reason — we both share an interest in birdwatching, say — we will assume that we share attitudes about politics, religion, and movies, too. Thus, causality works in both directions: We like people whose attitudes are similar to ours, and if we like someone, we attribute attitudes to him or her that are similar to ours.

One possibility is that, although we like to be around competent people, those who are too competent make us uncomfortable. They may seem unapproachable, distant, superhuman — and make us look bad (and feel worse) by comparison. If this were true, we might like people more if they reveal some evidence of fallibility.

One implication of this experiment is that people who are secure about themselves are less “needy”; that is, they are less likely to accept overtures from just anyone who comes along. Just as a starving person will accept almost any kind of food and a well-fed person can afford to turn down an offer of a soggy cheese sandwich, an insecure person will accept almost anyone who expresses interest, while a secure person will be more selective. Moreover, a person who feels insecure may even seek out a less attractive person to diminish the possibility of being rejected

As you can see, people like to be praised and tend to like the person who is complimenting them, but they also dislike being deceived or condescended to. If the praise is too lavish (“That’s the best essay I’ve ever read in my entire life!”), if it suggests surprise (“Great job — I had no idea you were smart!”), or if it seems that the praiser is being ingratiating for an ulterior motive, then praise can backfire.

The philosopher Baruch de Spinoza61 may have had something like this process in mind when, about 300 years ago, he observed: Hatred which is completely vanquished by love passes into love, and love is thereupon greater than if hatred had not preceded it. For he who begins to love a thing which he was wont to hate or regard with pain, from the very fact of loving, feels pleasure. To this pleasure involved in love is added the pleasure arising from aid given to the endeavor to remove the pain involved in hatred.

One tactic in particular — negging — caught my eye, because it depends on the gain-loss phenomenon. To neg someone means to begin the contact with a mild insult, often in the form of a compliment. (For example, “Wow, those shoes must be comfortable, given how ugly they are.”) Theoretically, negging has two effects. First, it distinguishes the speaker from all the other suitors who approach the woman with compliments; this makes him seem interesting. Second, it deals a blow to the woman’s self-esteem, which can make her want the insulter’s approval, which in turn motivates her to try to get it by spending more time with him. She then feels a warm gratification when she is able to change his apparently low opinion of her into a higher one. It’s a devious trick and, according to Strauss, good for starting a conversation with a woman or even getting her to go home with the guy. But is it the basis for a good relationship? I don’t think so. Indeed, at the end of Strauss’s book, he falls in love with a woman, in part because she responded to none of his tactics.

In exchange relationships, the people involved are concerned about reciprocity and making sure that some sort of equity is achieved, that there is fairness in the distribution of the rewards and costs to each of the partners. In this trade-like kind of relationship, if there is a major imbalance, both people become unhappy; the person getting less than they contribute feels angry or depressed, and the person getting more than they contribute usually feels guilty.

Passionate love is characterized by strong emotions, exhilaration, unquenchable sexual desire, and intense preoccupation with the beloved. Many describe passionate love as literally an altered state of consciousness, like that produced by marijuana or alcohol.

“Falling in love” provides a rush that is physiologically not much different from eating chocolate and winning the lottery; indeed, when gamblers win or people are imbibing their favorite chocolate, their brains show increased activity in dopamine-rich areas.

Like all drugs, though, the high of passionate love wears off after about a year to 18 months. If the relationship is solid, companionate love arises to take its place — a milder, more stable experience marked by feelings of mutual trust, dependability, and warmth.

One is at the peak of the passionate-love phase, when partners in a state of wild excitement dive in headfirst. High on passionate love, wanting to be together every second, they move in together or get married way too quickly. Sometimes these couples are able to transition from the passionate stage to the companionate one. But if, at this crucial moment, they believe that the only real love is the kind defined by obsession, sexual passion, and hot emotion, they may decide they are out of love when the initial phase of attraction fades, as it eventually must — and they will be repeatedly disappointed.

Philosopher Robert Solomon73 argued that, “We conceive of [love] falsely … We expect an explosion at the beginning powerful enough to fuel love through all of its ups and downs instead of viewing love as a process over which we have control, a process that tends to increase with time rather than wane.”

My friends and I were not unusual in holding that “soul mate” theory of love, the belief that one day the perfect person would come along, the ideal life companion. A lot of young people had that belief then and many have it now. That was our implicit theory of love and relationships, and it governed our behavior and how our romances played out.

contrast, couples who hold an implicit theory about love as growth put more effort into coping strategies. Over time, they remain more satisfied, even when they report that their partner no longer meets their original ideal. They expect their partner to evolve and change over time, and they have a better sense of the temporary nature of relationship slumps.

Children who are treated poorly and lack secure attachments may end up on a pathway that makes committed relationships difficult. As children, they have trouble regulating negative emotions; as teenagers, they have trouble dealing with and recovering from conflict with their peers; as adults, they tend to “protect” themselves by becoming the less-committed partner in their relationships.

This process suggests that once we have grown certain of the rewarding behavior of our long-term partner, that person may become less effective as a source of reward than a stranger. We know that gains are important, but a long-term lover or spouse is probably behaving near ceiling level and, therefore, cannot provide us with much of a gain. But a loved one has great potential to hurt us, by withdrawing support, appreciation, and other rewards. The closer the relationship and the greater the past history of invariant esteem and reward, the more devastating is their withdrawal. In effect, then, the long-term lover has more power to inflict loss than to provide additional gain, thereby hurting the one he or she loves.

Straight talk seems easy, and it is effective. Why don’t people use it more often? Growing up in a competitive society, most of us have learned how to protect ourselves by making ourselves relatively invulnerable — those quills again. Thus, when we are hurt, we have learned not to show it. Rather, we have learned either to avoid the person who hurt us or to lash out at him or her with anger, judgment, or ridicule, which in turn, as Gottman observed, makes the other person defensive or produces a counterattack, and the argument escalates.

Moreover, when we are busy criticizing, we often fail to give the other person the benefit of the doubt. As we have seen, a person’s judgments about another person can take the form of dispositional attributions (attributing the cause of that person’s behavior to a flaw in their personalities) or to situational attributions (attributing the cause to something going on at work or in other outside circumstances).

Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the small faces of the children whose bodies I saw transformed into smoke under a silent sky. Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to ashes. Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.

But now, I no longer pleaded for anything. I was no longer able to lament. On the contrary, I felt very strong. I was the accuser, God the accused.

I was nothing but ashes now, but I felt myself to be stronger than this Almighty to whom my life had been bound for so long.

Then he left, in the direction of the hospital. His step was almost steady and he never looked back. An ambulance was waiting to take him to Birkenau. There followed terrible days. We received more blows than food. The work was crushing. And three days after he left, we forgot to say Kaddish. WINTER HAD ARRIVED. The days became short and the nights almost unbearable. From the first hours of dawn, a glacial wind lashed us like a whip. We were handed winter clothing: striped shirts that were a bit heavier. The veterans grabbed the opportunity for further sniggering: “Now you’ll really get a taste of camp!” We went off to work as usual, our bodies frozen. The stones were so cold that touching them, we felt that our hands would remain stuck. But we got used to that too.

And that is why I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Wherever men and women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must—at that moment—become the center of the universe.

As it will become clearer throughout the book, however, economics can never be a science in the sense that physics or chemistry is. There are many different types of economic theory, each emphasizing different aspects of complex reality, making different moral and political value judgements and drawing different conclusions. Moreover, economic theories constantly fail to predict real-world developments even in areas on which they focus, not least because human beings have their own free will, unlike chemical molecules or physical objects.

The standard Neoclassical definition of economics, the variants of which are still used, is given in the 1932 book by Lionel Robbins, An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science. In the book, Robbins defined economics as ‘the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses’.

The most intuitive answer to most readers may be that the economy is anything to do with money – not having it, earning it, spending it, running out of it, saving it, borrowing it and repaying it. This is not quite right, but it is a good starting point for thinking about the economy – and economics.

The most common way to get money – unless you have been born into it – is to have a job (including being your own boss) and earn money from it. So, a lot of economics is about jobs. We can reflect on jobs from different perspectives.

In addition to holding down a job, you can get money through transfers – that is, by simply being given it. This can be either in the form of cash or ‘in kind’, that is, direct provision of particular goods (e.g., food) or services (e.g., primary education). Whether in cash or in kind, these transfers can be made in a number of different ways.

So a lot of economics is devoted to the study of consumption – how people allocate money between different types of goods and services, how they make choices between competing varieties of the same product, how they are manipulated and/or informed by advertisements, how companies spend money to build their ‘brand images’ and so on.

My belief is that economics should be defined not in terms of its methodology, or theoretical approach, but in terms of its subject matter, as is the case with all other disciplines. The subject matter of economics should be the economy – which involves money, work, technology, international trade, taxes and other things that have to do with the ways in which we produce goods and services, distribute the incomes generated in the process and consume the things thus produced – rather than ‘Life, the Universe and Everything’ (or ‘almost everything’), as many economists think.

Smith starts his book by arguing that the ultimate source of increase in wealth lies in the increase in productivity through greater division of labour, which refers to the division of production processes into smaller, specialized parts.

And to illustrate this point, Smith discusses how ten people dividing up the production process of making a pin and specializing in one or two of the sub-processes can produce 48,000 pins (or 4,800 pins per person) a day. Compare this to the at most 20 pins each of them can produce a day, Smith pointed out, if each individual worker performed the whole process alone.

what is the capitalist economy, or capitalism? It is an economy in which production is organized in pursuit of profit, rather than for own consumption (as in subsistence farming, where you grow your own food) or for political obligations (as in feudal societies or in socialist economies, where political authorities, respectively aristocrats and the central planning authority, tell you what to produce).

Today’s owners in most large corporations have only limited liabilities. In a limited liability company (LLC) or a public limited company (PLC), if something goes wrong with the company, shareholders only lose the money invested in their shares and that is that. In Smith’s time, most company owners had unlimited liabilities, which meant that when the business failed, they had to sell their own personal assets to pay back the debts, failing which they ended up in a debtors’ prison.

Smith was against the principle of limited liability. He argued that those who manage limited liability companies without owning them are playing with ‘other people’s money’ (his phrase, and the title of a famous play and then 1991 movie, starring Danny DeVito) and thus won’t be as vigilant in their management as those who have to risk everything they have.

But even these fixed-denomination notes were not notes in the modern sense, as their values were explicitly linked to precious metals like gold or silver that the issuing bank possessed. This is known as the Gold (or Silver or other) Standard.

The Gold (Silver) Standard is a monetary system in which the paper money issued by the central bank is freely exchangeable with a specified weight of gold (or silver). This did not mean that the central bank had to have in reserve an amount of gold equal to the value of the currency that it had issued; however, the convertibility of paper money into gold made it necessary for it to hold a very large gold reserve – for example, the US Federal Reserve Board kept gold equivalent to 40 per cent of the value of currency it issued.

The result was that the central bank had little discretion in deciding how much paper money it could issue. The Gold Standard was first adopted by Britain in 1717 – by Isaac Newton,* the then head of the Royal Mint – and adopted by the other European countries in the 1870s. This system played a very important role in the evolution of capitalism in the next two generations, but

After the shift of direction in 1816, the US trade policy became increasingly protectionist. By the 1830s, the country was boasting the highest average industrial tariff in the world – a status that it would keep for (almost all of) the next hundred years, until the Second World War. During that century, tariffs were much lower in states such as Germany, France and Japan – states that people these days normally associate with protectionism.

Some of it happened in the heartland of capitalism in the 1860s – Britain’s adoption of free trade and the signing of a series of bilateral free-trade agreements (or FTAs), in which two countries abolish import restrictions and tariffs on each other’s exports, among the Western European countries. But much of the spread happened on the periphery of capitalism, in Latin America and Asia.

Through ‘gunboat diplomacy’, they were forced to sign unequal treaties that deprived them of, among other things, tariff autonomy (the right to set their own tariffs).11 They were allowed to use only a low uniform tariff rate (3–5 per cent) – enough to raise some government revenue but not enough for infant industry protection.

In addition, organization of the production process was revolutionized in many industries by the invention of the mass production system. The use of a moving assembly line (conveyor belt) and interchangeable parts dramatically lowered production costs. This system of production is the backbone (if not the entirety) of our production system today, despite frequent talks of its demise since the 1980s.

With larger companies came larger banks. The risk was then heightened that the failure of one bank could destabilisze the whole financial system, so central banks were set up to deal with such problems by acting as the lender of last resort, starting with the Bank of England in 1844.

This liberalism on the international front was matched by the laissez-faire approach to domestic economic policy (see the box below for definitions of these terms). Allowance of maximum freedom for business, pursuit of a balanced budget (that is, the government spending exactly as much as it collects in taxes) and the adoption of the Gold Standard were the key ingredients, they say. Things were, however, far more complicated.

The liberal golden age of 1870–1913 was thus not as liberal as we think. It was getting less liberal in the core capitalist countries, in terms of both domestic and international policies. Liberalization happened mostly in the weaker countries, but out of compulsion rather than choice – through colonialism and unequal treaties.

This was the view most famously expounded in Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism by Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Russian Revolution in 1917. The Russian Revolution was an even bigger shock to the defenders of capitalism than the First World War, as it led to the creation of an economic system that claims to undermine all the cornerstones of capitalism.

Even many Marxists, especially Karl Kautsky, were sceptical about its prospects – socialism was, according to Marx himself, supposed to emerge from the most developed capitalist economies. Those economies were only a step away from a fully planned economy, it was argued, because their economic activities were already planned to a high degree by large enterprises and cartels of those enterprises. The Soviet Union – even its more developed European part – was a very backward economy in which capitalism had been hardly developed, where socialism really had no business emerging.

After a big financial crisis like the 1929 Wall Street crash or the 2008 global financial crisis, private-sector spending falls. Debts go unpaid, which forces banks to reduce their lending. Being unable to borrow, firms and individuals cut their spending. This, in turn, reduces demands for other firms and individuals that used to sell to them (e.g., firms selling to consumers, firms selling machinery to other firms, workers selling labour services to firms). The demand level in the economy spirals down. In this environment, the government is the only economic actor that can maintain the level of demand in the economy by spending more than it earns, that is, by running a budget deficit.

The reforms were particularly widespread and far-reaching in the US, where the Depression was the greatest and lasted the longest. The so-called First New Deal programme (1933–4) under the new president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, separated the commercial and investment arms of banks (the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act), set up the bank deposit insurance system to protect small savers against bank failures, tightened stock market regulation (the 1933 Federal Securities Act), expanded and strengthened the farm credit system, provided a minimum farm price guarantee and developed infrastructure (such as the Hoover Dam

The period between 1945, the end of the Second World War, and 1973, the first Oil Shock, is often called the ‘Golden Age of capitalism’. The period really deserves the name, as it achieved the highest growth rate ever. Between 1950 and 1973, per capita income in Western Europe grew at an astonishing rate of 4.1 per cent per year. The US grew more slowly, but at an unprecedented rate of 2.5 per cent.

The World Bank was established to provide loans for ‘project lending’ (that is, money that is given to particular investment projects, such as building a dam). By providing loans of longer maturities and/or lower interest rates than are offered by the private-sector banks, the World Bank enabled its client countries to invest more aggressively than otherwise possible.

In 1971, the US dropped its commitment to convert any dollar claims into gold, which led other countries to abandon the practice of tying their national currencies to the dollar at fixed rates over the next couple of years. This created instability in the world economy, with currency values fluctuating according to market sentiments and becoming increasingly subject to currency speculation (investors betting on currencies moving up or down in value).

The Thatcher government lowered higher-rate income taxes, reduced government spending (especially in education, housing and transport), introduced laws reducing union power and abolished capital control (restriction on the cross-border movement of money). The most symbolic move was privatization – sales of SOEs to private investors. Gas, water, electricity, steel, airline, automobile and parts of public housing were privatized.

Ronald Reagan, the former actor and a former governor of California, became the US president in 1981 and outdid Margaret Thatcher. The Reagan government aggressively cut the higher income tax rates, explaining that these cuts would give the rich greater incentives to invest and create wealth, as they could keep more of the fruits of their investments. Once they created more wealth, it was argued, the rich would spend more, creating more jobs and incomes for everyone else; this is known as the trickle-down theory.

Most developing countries had borrowed heavily in the 1970s and the early 1980s, partly to finance their industrialization and partly to pay for the more expensive oil, following the Oil Shocks. When the US interest rates doubled, so did international interest rates, and this led to a widespread default on foreign debts by developing nations, starting with the default of Mexico in 1982. This is known as the Third World Debt Crisis, thus known because the developing world was then called the Third World, after the First World (the advanced capitalist world) and the Second World (the socialist world).

Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board between August 1987 and January 2006, was revered as the ‘Maestro’ (as immortalized in the title of his biography by Bob Woodward of Watergate fame) who had a near-alchemical skill in managing a permanent economic boom without stoking inflation or courting financial trouble.

The initial responses of the major economies were very different from those following the Great Depression. Macroeconomic policies were Keynesian in the sense that they let huge budget deficits develop – at least not by cutting spending in line with falling tax revenues and in some cases by increasing government spending (China did this most aggressively). Major financial institutions (e.g., the UK’s Royal Bank of Scotland) and industrial firms (e.g., GM and Chrysler in the US) were bailed out with public money. Central banks brought interest rates down to historical lows – for example, the Bank of England cut its interest rate to the lowest level since its foundation in 1694.

May 2010 was the turning point. The election of the Conservative-led coalition government in the UK and the imposition of the Eurozone bail-out programme for Greece in that month signalled the comeback of the old balanced budget doctrine. Austerity budgets, in which spending is cut radically, have been imposed in the UK and in the so-called PIIGS economies (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain). The success of the Republicans in pushing the Obama government in the US to accept a huge spending cut programme in 2011 and the reaffirmation of the anti-deficit bias of the core European countries in the form of the European Fiscal Compact, signed in 2012, pushed things even further in that direction.

Since the market was incapable of naturally generating a recession, any government attempt to counter it, say, through deliberate deficit spending, was condemned as disturbing the natural order. This meant that recessions that could have been cut short or made milder became prolonged in the days of Classical economics.

Ricardo developed a new theory of international trade, known as the theory of comparative advantage, further strengthening the argument for free trade. His theory showed that, under certain assumptions, even when a country cannot produce any product more cheaply than another country can, free trade between them will allow both to maximize their outputs. They can achieve this by specializing in, and exporting, products in which they have comparative advantage – those with the largest relative cost advantages in the case of the more efficient country and those with the smallest relative cost disadvantages in the case of the less efficient country.

The school, especially Ricardo, emphasized that it is in the long-term interest of everyone that the greatest share of national income go to the capitalist class (that is, profits), because it is the only class that invests and generates economic growth; the working class was too poor to save and invest, while the landlord class was using its income (rents) on ‘unproductive’ luxury consumption, such as the employment of servants.

It emphasized the role of demand conditions (derived from the subjective valuation of products by consumers) in the determination of the value of a good. Classical economists believed that the value of a product is determined by supply conditions, that is, the costs of its production. They measured the costs by the labour time expended in producing it – this is known as the labour theory of value.

Despite these differences, the Neoclassical school inherited and developed two central ideas of the Classical school. The first is the idea that economic actors are driven by self-interest but that the competition in the market ensures that their actions collectively produce a socially benign outcome.

The other is the idea that markets are self-equilibrating. The conclusion is, as in Classical economics, that capitalism – or, rather, the market economy, as the school prefers to call it – is a system that is best left alone, as it has a tendency to revert to the equilibrium.

Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923) argued that, if we respect the rights of every sovereign individual, we should consider a social change an improvement only when it makes some people better off without making anyone worse off. There should be no more individual sacrifices in the name of the ‘greater good’. This is known as the Pareto criterion and forms the basis for all judgements on social improvements in Neoclassical economics today.6 In real life, unfortunately, there are few changes that hurt no one; thus the Pareto criterion effectively becomes a recipe to stick to the status quo and let things be – laissez faire. Its adoption thus imparted a huge conservative bias to the Neoclassical school.

The more fundamental of these was the birth of welfare economics, or the market failure approach, developed by Cambridge professor Arthur Pigou in the 1920s. Pigou argued that there are occasions when market prices fail to reflect the true social costs and benefits. For example, a factory may pollute air and water because air and water have no market prices and thus it can treat them as free goods. But as a result of such ‘over-production’ of pollution, the environment is destroyed, and the society suffers.

The problem is that the effects of some economic activities are not priced in the market and thus not reflected in economic decisions – this is known as an externality.

A more minor yet important modification came in the 1930s, in the form of the compensation principle. The principle proposes that a change may be deemed a social improvement even when it violates the Pareto criterion (in the sense of there being some losers), if the total gains for the gainers are large enough to compensate all the losers and still leave something behind. By allowing them to endorse a change that may hurt some people (but can fully compensate for their damages), the compensation principle has allowed Neoclassical economists to avoid the ultra-conservative bias of the Pareto criterion. Of course, the trouble is that the compensation is rarely made in reality.

With these modifications, there was no reason for the Neoclassical school to remain committed to free-market policies any more. Indeed, between the 1930s and the 1970s, many Neoclassical economists were not free-market economists. The current state of affairs in which the predominant majority of Neoclassical economists are of free-market leaning is actually due more to the shift in political ideology since the 1980s than to the absence or the poor quality of theories within Neoclassical economics

The Marxist school of economics emerged from the works of Karl Marx, produced between the 1840s and the 1860s, starting with the publication of The Communist Manifesto in 1848 (co-authored with Friedrich Engels (1820–95), his intellectual partner and financial patron) and culminating in the publication of the first volume of Capital in 1867.8 It was further developed in Germany and Austria and then in the Soviet Union in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries.* More recently, it was elaborated in the US and Europe during the 1960s and the 1970s.

Every society is seen as being built on an economic base, or the mode of production. This base is made up of the forces of production (technologies, machines, human skills) and the relations of production (property rights, employment relationship, division of labour). Upon this base is the superstructure, which comprises culture, politics and other aspects of human life, which in turn affect the way the economy is run.

the Marxist school saw societies as evolving through a series of historical stages, defined in terms of their mode of production: primitive communism (‘tribal’ societies); antiquarian mode of production (based on slavery, as in Greece and Rome); feudalism (based on landlords commanding semi-slaves, or serfs, tied to their lands); capitalism; communism.* Capitalism is seen as but one stage of human development before we reach the ultimate stage of communism.

It viewed class conflicts as the central force of history – summarized in the declaration in The Communist Manifesto: ‘The history of hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.’ Moreover, the school refused to see the working class as a passive entity, as did the Classical school, and accorded it an active role in history.

They pulled together elements from different sources in a pragmatic, eclectic manner, even though some of them have made important original contributions of their own. But the tradition is no less important for that. It is arguably the most important intellectual tradition in economics in terms of its impact on the real world. It is this tradition, rather than the narrow rationalism of Neoclassical economics or the Marxist vision of classless society, that has been behind almost all of the successful economic development experiences in human history, from eighteenth-century Britain, through nineteenth-century America and Germany, down to today’s China.

belonging to the tradition, economic development is not simply a matter of increasing income, which could happen due to a resource bonanza, such as striking oil or diamonds.

However, it argues, these activities do not naturally develop in a backward economy, as they are already conducted by firms in the more advanced economies. In such an economy, unless the government intervenes – with tariffs, subsidies and regulations – to promote such activities, free markets will constantly pull it back to what it is already good at – namely, low-productivity activities, based on natural resources or cheap labour.

The most important innovation came from Hirschman, who pointed out that some industries have particularly dense linkages (or connections) with other industries; in other words, they buy from – and sell to – a particularly large number of industries. If the government identified and deliberately promoted these industries (the automobile and the steel industries are common examples), the economy would grow more vigorously than when left to the market.

The Austrian school is these days in the same laissez-faire camp with the free-market wing (today the majority) of the Neoclassical school, producing similar, if somewhat more extreme, policy conclusions.

The Austrian school also argues that the world is highly complex and uncertain. As its members pointed out in the Calculation Debate, it is impossible for anyone – even the all-powerful central planning authority of a socialist country that can demand any information it wants from anyone – to acquire all the information needed to run a complex economy. It is only through the spontaneous order of the competitive market that the diverse and ever-changing plans of numerous economic actors, responding to unpredictable and complex shifts of the world, can be reconciled with each other.

Thus, the Austrians say that the free market is the best economic system not because we are perfectly rational and know everything (or at least can know everything that we need to know), as in Neoclassical theories, but exactly because we are not very rational and because there are so many things in the world that are inherently ‘unknowable’. This defence of the free market is a lot more realistic than the Neoclassical one, based on the assumption of absurd degrees of human rationality and on the unrealistic belief in the ‘knowability’ of the world.

Schumpeter developed Marx’s emphasis on the role of technological development as the driving force of capitalism. He argued that capitalism develops through innovations by entrepreneurs, namely, the creation of new production technologies, new products and new markets. Innovations give the successful entrepreneurs temporary monopolies in their respective markets, allowing them to earn exceptional profit, which he called the entrepreneurial profit. Over time, their competitors imitate the innovations, forcing everyone’s profit down to the ‘normal’ level;

On this, Schumpeter has proven prescient. He argued that no firm, however entrenched it may look, is safe from these ‘gales of creative destruction’ in the long run. The decline of companies like IBM and General Motors, or the disappearance of Kodak, which at their peaks dominated the world in their respective industries, demonstrates the power of competition through innovation.

Keynes started from the obvious observation that an economy doesn’t consume all that it produces. The difference – that is, savings – needs to be invested, if everything that has been produced is to be sold and if all productive inputs, including the labour service of workers, are to be employed (this is known as full employment).

In a press briefing regarding the situation in Afghanistan in 2002, Rumsfeld opined: ‘There are known knowns. There are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know we don’t know.’ The idea of ‘unknown unknowns’ nicely sums up Keynes’ concept of uncertainty.

Keynes argued that this does not happen. As investment falls, overall spending falls, which then reduces income, as one person’s spending is another’s income. A reduction in income in turn reduces savings, as savings are essentially what are left after consumption (which tends not to change much in response to a fall in income, being determined by our survival necessities and habit). In the end, savings will contract to match the now lower investment demand. If excess savings are reduced in this way, there will be no downward pressure on interest rates and thus no extra stimulus for investment.

Keynes thought that investment will be high enough for full employment only when animal spirits – ‘a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction’, as he defines it – of the potential investors are stimulated by new technologies, financial euphoria and other unusual events. The normal state of affairs, in his view, would be that investment is equated to savings at a level of effective demand (the demand that is actually backed up by purchasing power) that is insufficient to support full employment. In order to achieve full employment, Keynes argued, the government therefore has to use its spending actively to prop up the level of demand.

The prevalence of uncertainty in Keynesian economics means that money is not simply an accounting unit or merely a convenient medium of exchange, as the Classical (and the Neoclassical) school thought. It is a means to provide liquidity (or the means to quickly change one’s financial position) in an uncertain world.

No truly global “world order” has ever existed. What passes for order in our time was devised in Western Europe nearly four centuries ago, at a peace conference in the German region of Westphalia, conducted without the involvement or even the awareness of most other continents or civilizations. A century of sectarian conflict and political upheaval across Central Europe had culminated in the Thirty Years’ War of 1618–48—a conflagration in which political and religious disputes commingled, combatants resorted to “total war” against population centers, and nearly a quarter of the population of Central Europe died from combat, disease, or starvation.

Given our bounded rationality, Simon argued, we develop mental ‘shortcuts’ that allow us to economize on our mental capabilities. These are known as heuristics (or intuitive thinking) and can take different forms: rule of thumb, common sense or expert judgement. Underlying all these mental devices is the ability to recognize patterns, which allows us to abandon a large range of alternatives and focus on a small, manageable but most promising range of possibilities.

Focusing on a subset of possibilities means that the resulting choice may not be optimal, but this approach enables us to handle the complexity and the uncertainty of the world with our bounded rationality. Therefore, Simon argues, when they make their choices, human beings satisfice, that is, we look for ‘good enough’ solutions rather than the best ones, as in the Neoclassical theory.

The dominant Neoclassical view is that economics is the ‘science of choice’, as we saw in Chapter 1. According to this position, choices are made by individuals, who are assumed to be selfish, only interested in maximizing their own welfare – or at most that of their family members. In doing so, all individuals are seen to make rational choices, namely, they choose the most cost-efficient way to achieve a given goal.

Dispersed ownership means that professional managers have effective control over most of the world’s largest companies, despite not owning any significant stake in them – a situation known as the separation of ownership and control. This creates a principal-agent problem, in which the agents (professional managers) may pursue business practices that promote their own interests rather than those of their principals (shareholders). That is, professional managers may maximize sales rather than profit or may inflate the corporate bureaucracy, as their prestige is positively related to the size of the company they manage (usually measured by sales) and the size of their entourage.

The second is paying large parts of managerial salaries in the form of their own companies’ stocks (stock option), so that they are made to look at things more from the shareholder’s point of view. The idea was summarized in the term shareholder value maximization, coined in 1981 by Jack Welch, the then new CEO and chairman of General Electric, and has since ruled the corporate sector first in the Anglo-American world and increasingly in the rest of the world.

In addition to trade union activities (which we’ll explore below), workers in some European countries, such as Germany and Sweden, influence what their companies do through formal representation on company boards. In particular in Germany, large companies have a two-tier board structure. Under this system, known as the co-determination system, the ‘managerial board’ (like the board of directors in other countries) has to get the most important decisions, such as merger and plant closure, approved by the ‘supervisor board’, in which worker representatives have half the votes, even though the managerial side appoints the chairman, who has the casting vote.

In modern economies, at least some workers do not make economic decisions as individuals any more. Many workers are organized into trade unions, or labour unions. Allowing workers to bargain as a group, rather than as individuals who may compete against each other, trade unions help workers extract higher wages and better working conditions from their employers.

In most countries, the government is by far the single largest employer, employing anything up to 25 per cent of the national workforce in some cases.* Its expenditure is equivalent to anything between 10 and 55 per cent of national output, with the ratio generally higher in the richer countries than in the poorer ones.

Some international organizations are important because – how shall I put it? – they have money. The World Bank and other ‘regional’ multilateral banks, predominantly owned by rich country governments, make loans to developing countries.* When they lend, they offer more favourable terms (lower interest rates, longer repayment periods) than do private-sector banks.

Most importantly, the US has de facto veto power in the Bank and the Fund, as the most important decisions in them require an 85 per cent majority, and the US happens to own 18 per cent of shares.

The WTO sets rules on international economic interactions, including international trade, international investment and even the cross-border protection of intellectual property rights, such as patents and copyrights. It is, importantly, the only international organization that is based on the one-country-one-vote rule.

The multiple-self problem shows that individuals are not atoms because they can be broken down further. They are not atoms also because they are not clearly separable from other individuals.

Margaret Thatcher was seriously wrong when she famously (or infamously) said, ‘There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families.’ There cannot be such a thing as an individual without society.
