My recommendation of emergency funds has now changed. For those forty years and below in secure jobs, you are fine with six months of living expenses in an FD, but as the age increases and as the riskiness of the job goes up, ramp up the fund to reach two years for older cohorts in jobs that are not that secure.

We need to understand the difference between risk appetite and risk capacity. Risk capacity is the ability to take risk. Risk appetite is the willingness to take risk. Capacity is about your age, stage, number of dependents, confidence about your ability to keep generating income for a long time.

Appetite is the desire to take risk. This depends on how well you understand money, finance, your own skills, your own ability to manage your portfolio or ability to hire a planner to do this work. My biggest lesson was that both risk capacity and appetite need to be aligned.

Ideally your total fixed obligation-to-income ratio (FOIR) should be 30 per cent or less. This means that all your EMIs put together must not be more than 30 per cent of your take home money. If your take-home is Rs 1 lakh, your EMIs are no larger than Rs 30,000. Remember, this is a maximum. I would be much happier with a 15–20 per cent ratio. Imagine a salary cut of 25 per cent and then look at your paying capacity.

Why does the bank want higher deposits? Because your money is lent out to others – loans earn the bank anywhere between 10 per cent to 18 per cent, while you get around 4 per cent interest on your savings deposit. The difference between what you get and what the bank earns, minus costs, is the bank’s profit.

What stops you from dipping into your Invest-it Account to pay for your spending? This is where behavioural economics steps in. Putting a label on money prevents people from using it for any other purpose. This is called ‘mental accounting’ and it means that we like to separate our money into separate accounts according to intent, and dislike using it for any other use.

What about the unplanned things – like the car getting rammed while quietly parked outside the house and needing a fender change? These are unplanned expenses, and unless you have a comprehensive car cover, you will be out of pocket for the cost of getting the car back in shape. There are many such unplanned emergency expenses that living our urban mass affluent life brings us: a large hospital bill, getting fired and not having an income, Chennai-like floods needing a full replacement of the basement furniture and gadgets.

If you are banking with a bank that allows flexi-FDs that allow you to sweep out just the amount you need, rather than breaking the entire deposit, go for that. Else split your emergency fund into smaller FDs so that you don’t have to lose the interest on the entire deposit.

Understand debt mutual fund products before you begin to use it for an emergency fund. There are several advantages to this product. It earns you a better return, is more liquid than an FD and can have a lower tax incidence than an FD if you plan its use well. The higher post-tax return as compared to a bank FD makes a debt fund a great choice for an emergency fund. I know some investors who, once having understood mutual funds, moved to a balanced fund with a small equity exposure as their emergency fund.

But we can still work with some rules of thumb. You need a basic cover of Rs 3–15 lakhs per person. Use the Rs 3 lakh number for smaller towns and less posh facilities, and the Rs 15 lakh number for metros and all the bells and whistles. For a nuclear family it makes sense to get a product called a ‘family floater’ that allows the insurance cover to whichever member of the family that needs it.

Look at the policy as a three-part decision. One, how does it perform on the metric of price. Two, how does it perform on the metric of benefits. Three, how does it perform on the metric of claims. You may have the cheapest policy with the best benefits, but if the company’s claims policy rejects a large number of claims, the policy is not of much use.

This is called ‘co-pay’ because you agree to pay a certain percentage of a bill to share the costs with the insurance company. Unfair, you exclaim. It is, except when a senior citizen goes to buy a cover, co-pay allows him to at least get a cover.

Two, check for a ‘pre-existing’ disease clause. Insurance companies will not cover diseases that you already have when you take the policy. Insurance rules allow a company to refuse to pay for any treatment related to any condition, ailment or injury for which you were diagnosed or had symptoms when you took the policy, for four years.

But a caveat here: People with any pre-existing disease find it difficult to get a cover. Some insurance companies use this clause to refuse claims for totally unrelated ailments. It is a good idea to disclose your correct present and past medical history to the insurance company when you sign up for the policy. Else they will have a tool in their hands to refuse your claim. And, believe me, they use it to refuse claims on very flimsy grounds.

Many companies have a cool-off period of thirty to ninety days during which they will not pay any claim. Some ailments such as cataract or hernia may have a ‘waiting period’ before the company will pay. Ask the agent to list out all diseases that are covered under this clause. Look for a policy that does not have a waiting period on diseases or coverage.

You need to check this carefully. A sub-limit is a limitation on what the company will pay out for specific things. We usually stumble upon a sub-limit on room rent. There are two kinds of limits on room rents – either by price or by category.

Some companies take their aversion to giving cover to people with a pre-existing ailment to ridiculous lengths.

What to do? The best way to get a larger cover is to use what is called a ‘top-up’ plan. Think of this as a policy that will pay up after a certain threshold amount has been paid by you. Suppose you have an existing policy for Rs 3-lakh medical cover. Now you buy a top-up plan that gives you another Rs 5 lakhs of cover, but after a Rs 3-lakh deductible. If your medical bill is Rs 4 lakhs, you will pay Rs 3 lakhs from your basic policy and Rs 1 lakh from your top-up.

The typical endowment insurance policy gives you a tiny crust of life insurance cover; it is usually ten times your premium. So if your premium is Rs 50,000 a year, your life cover is Rs 5 lakhs. It also promises to give you a return on your money. And that is the carrot for you – you get a ‘cover’, so your family’s safe; you get a return and you get a tax break. The pista on the jalebi is that the money at maturity is tax-free.

Why do they get sold so hard? Because of the way the incentive structure is built into life insurance in India. The first-year commission (in 2020 for a more than 11 years regular premium traditional policy) is up to 35 per cent of your premium. For Rs 1 lakh that you invest, up to Rs 35,000 goes to the agent who pushes the policy at you. This is the legal payment. Insurance companies find ways to give commissions on top of what is legally allowed. One large agency firm told me that they can easily get 80 per cent of the first premium as commission.

Rule One: Get a cheap plan. The online plans are the cheapest since they remove the agent commission (up to 35 per cent of your first-year premium) – from the price of the insurance.

Not having money to invest is one of the four big reasons we put off the investing decision. At number two is the desire to keep money in a liquid form for a future emergency. Third is the fear of making a mistake and fourth is the lack of knowledge

Each financial product has a certain time period over which it works best. A product that is very safe in the long run becomes very risky in the short term. And a product that works in the short term becomes a drag on returns if you hold it too long. When you now think of a financial product, learn to ask the question: Over what holding time period does this work the best?

Debt is just an umbrella term for all financial products that are based on borrowing. Equity is ownership of a business and the risk that it brings, either directly (through stocks) or indirectly (through mutual funds). Real assets are those that can be physically seen. Debt and equity are called ‘financial assets’, while real estate and gold are called ‘real assets’.

But when used by the sharp Suits, debt means the cell with products that give you an assured return – like a bank fixed deposit or a tax-free bond or a public provident fund.

The core of the product is a loan. When you make a deposit with the bank, it treats it as a loan from you. And needs to give a periodic return, and then the principal back to you after an agreed upon time. These are products where two things are fixed – how much you will get back and when you will get it back. You are loaning money to the bank or the bond issuer and the interest is the price of this loan.

Why do you get an interest on your money? Because by not using it today you have postponed consumption – you need to be compensated for that. By pushing the use of Rs 1 lakh to five years later, you take the risk of the money losing value to inflation – you must be compensated for that. By lending money, you also take the risk of the borrower not returning it – you need to be compensated for that.

Without a benchmark there is no comparison of returns in finance. If somebody offers you a rate of interest that is much higher than a bank FD, understand that the risk of non-payment of both your investment and the interest on this deal is much higher.

Remember these are bullion prices. If you bought jewellery thinking you are making an investment, the numbers in the table above are all much lower. You lose 30 per cent straightaway to making charges when you buy gold as jewellery. No, I’m not saying no to jewellery. I enjoy my own gold trinkets, but I’m sure that these are not part of my investments at all. I buy jewellery because I enjoy wearing or gifting it. For my investments, I stay with mutual funds.

And that brings me to my second reason for our love for real estate – black money. Gold and real estate have been the sumps of black money in India. Most of the second sales in real estate take place in cash, and dealing in black is like a treadmill – once you get on it, you have to keep running with the money.

The third reason to choose real estate is just fear of the unknown. Twenty to thirty years ago, there were not many investment avenues – gold, real estate, bank deposits and LIC were what everybody had chosen to invest in. But now the presence of mutual funds, which have a product for most needs, does give a better choice set.

If you grew up when inflation was high, you invested less of your money in bonds later in life compared to those who grew up when inflation was low.

Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.

It’s possible to statistically measure whether some decisions were wise. But in the real world, day to day, we simply don’t. It’s too hard. We prefer simple stories, which are easy but often devilishly misleading.

I’ve come to realize that someone else’s failure is usually attributed to bad decisions, while your own failures are usually chalked up to the dark side of risk. When judging your failures I’m likely to prefer a clean and simple story of cause and effect, because I don’t know what’s going on inside your head. “You had a bad outcome so it must have been caused by a bad decision” is the story that makes the most sense to me. But when judging myself I can make up a wild narrative justifying my past decisions and attributing bad outcomes to risk.

Heller responds, “Yes, but I have something he will never have … enough.” Enough. I was stunned by the simple eloquence of that word—stunned for two reasons: first, because I have been given so much in my own life and, second, because Joseph Heller couldn’t have been more accurate.

Warren Buffett later put it: To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense. There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.

The amazing thing here is how big something can grow from a relatively small change in conditions. You start with a thin layer of snow left over from a cool summer that no one would think anything of and then, in a geological blink of an eye, the entire Earth is covered in miles-thick ice. As glaciologist Gwen Schultz put it: “It is not necessarily the amount of snow that causes ice sheets but the fact that snow, however little, lasts.”

But good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated.

Conflict is, as we’ve seen, a fundamental element of fiction. Playwright and director Elia Kazan describes it simply as “two dogs fighting over a bone.” William Faulkner reminds us that in addition to a conflict of wills, fiction shows “the heart in conflict with itself”; that is, conflict seethes both within and between characters. In life, “conflict” often carries negative connotations, yet in fiction, be it comic or tragic, dramatic conflict is fundamental, because in literature only trouble is interesting.

Only trouble is interesting. This is not so in life. Life offers periods of comfortable communication, peaceful pleasure, and productive work, all of which are extremely interesting to those involved. But passages about such times by themselves make for dull reading; they can be used as lulls in an otherwise tense situation, as a resolution, even as a hint that something awful is about to happen. They cannot be used as a whole plot.

As Charles Baxter, in Burning Down the House, more vividly puts it: Say what you will about it, Hell is story-friendly. If you want a compelling story, put your protagonist among the damned. The mechanisms of hell are nicely attuned to the mechanisms of narrative. Not so the pleasures of Paradise. Paradise is not a story. It’s about what happens when the stories are over.

Charles Baxter laments that “in writing workshops, this kind of story is often the rule rather than the exception.” He calls it “the fiction of finger-pointing”: In such fiction, the plot involves a search for someone or something to blame as a cause of the protagonist’s unhappiness. That’s the whole story. When blame has been assigned, the story is over. In such flawed stories, the central character (and by implication, the story’s author) seems to take no responsibility for what she or he wants to have happen. This is quite different from Aristotle’s rather startling claim that a man is his desire, or Robert Olen Butler’s definition of fiction as “the art of human yearning.”

Once conflict is established and developed in a story, the conflict must come to a crisis—the final turning point—and a resolution. Order is a major value that literature offers us, and order implies that the subject has been brought to closure. In life this never quite happens, but whether or not the lives of fictional characters end, the story does, and we are left with a satisfying sense of completion. What follows are several ways—they are all essentially metaphors—of seeing this pattern of conflict-crisis-resolution in order to make the shape and its variations clearer, and particularly to indicate what a crisis action

The editor and teacher Mel McKee states flatly that “a story is a war. It is sustained and immediate combat.” He offers four imperatives for the writing of this “war” story: (1) get your fighters fighting, (2) have something—the stake—worth their fighting over, (3) have the fight dive into a series of battles with the last battle in the series the biggest and most dangerous of all, (4) have a walking away from the fight.

As long as one antagonist can recoup enough power to counterattack, the conflict goes on. But, at some point in the story, one of the antagonists will produce a weapon from which the other cannot recover. The crisis action is the last battle and makes the outcome inevitable; there can no longer be any doubt who wins the particular territory—though there can be much doubt about moral victory. When this has happened the conflict ends with a significant and permanent change—which is the definition, in fiction, of a resolution.

In his writing classes, novelist Michael Shaara used to describe a story as a power struggle between equal forces. It is imperative, he argued, that each antagonist have sufficient power that the reader is left in doubt about the outcome. We may be wholly in sympathy with one character and even reasonably confident that she or he will triumph. But the antagonist must represent a real and potent danger, and the pattern of the story’s complications will be achieved by shifting the power back and forth from one antagonist to the other. Finally, an action will occur that will shift the power irreversibly in one direction.

Climate was the all-important factor, changed by the earth’s position in relation to the sun or by short-term circumstances. A huge pattern emerges, of recurrent swings of temperature. The extremes which resulted, of climatic cooling on the one hand and aridity on the other, choked off some possible lines of development.

Both aridification and the spread of grassland, for instance, changed the possibilities of species spreading themselves into new areas, especially if they could stand upright and move on two feet. Some of those species form part of the human evolutionary story, and all the most important stages in that evolution – so far observed – have been located in Africa, far from the ice-fields.

The earliest fragments of their fossils have been identified as over 4 million years old, but the oldest complete skull and a nearly complete skeleton found near Johannesburg in 1998 are probably at least half-a-million years ‘younger’ than that. This is not very different (allowing for the generous stretches of time and approximation available in prehistoric chronology) from the dating of ‘Lucy’, formerly the most complete specimen of Australopithecus discovered (in Ethiopia).

A site at the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania has provided the traces of the first identified building, a windbreak of stones which has been dated 1.9 million years ago, as well as evidence that its inhabitants were meat-eaters, in the form of bones smashed to enable the marrow and brains to be got at and eaten raw.

Olduvai prompts a tempting speculation. The bringing of stones and meat to the site combines with other evidence to suggest that the children of early hominins could not easily cling to their mother for long foraging expeditions as do the offspring of other primates. It may be that this is the first trace of the human institution of the home base. Among primates, only humans have them: places where females and children normally stay while the males search for food to bring back to them.

The semivowels are / h, j , I, m, n, r, s, v, w, x, y, z, and c and g soft. But w or y at the end of a syllable is a vowel. And the sound of c, f, g, h, j , s, or x can be protracted only as an aspirate, or strong breath. Four of the semivowels—/, m, n, and r—are termed liquids, on account of the fluency of their sounds. Four others— v, tv, y, and z—are likewise more vocal than the aspirates. A mute is a consonant that cannot be sounded at all without a vowel, and which at the end of a syllable suddenly stops the breath, as k, p, t, in ak, ap, at. The mutes are eight: b, d, k, p, q, t, and c and g hard. Three of these— k, g, and c hard— sound exactly alike. B, d, and g hard stop the voice less suddenly than the rest.

The general idea is to try and keep the pressure inside approximately 1 bar above air pressure. At this increased air pressure, water boils at 121oC. So, a pressure cooker is, in its simplest sense, a device that lets you cook using liquid water at 121oC (unlike an open vessel that allows you to do this at 100oC).

That said, try and avoid pressure-cooking for meats and seafood. Rather counter-intuitively, meats tend to dry out even with moist cooking methods. The key to great-tasting meat is to ensure that its internal temperature never goes above 70oC. In a literal pressure-cooker atmosphere, that is simply not possible, so the chances that you will end up with dry, overcooked pieces is very high

Rice is designed to nourish the next generation of rice plants, much like an egg is designed to nourish the next generation of chickens. The germ is the next baby rice plant. The husk, which is the rough protective layer for the grain, is inedible unless you are a cow, and while the bran is highly nutritious and contains proteins and fat (the source of rice bran oil), it goes rancid quickly. This is why brown rice, which is rice with the bran and germ included, has a short shelf life.

When the whole grain is partially boiled, it drives a good amount of the useful nutrients found in the bran and germ into the endosperm. This is why parboiled rice is almost as nutritious as brown rice and has the shelf life of regular white rice. This is also why most heavy rice-eating parts of India tend to have a diet that includes both parboiled and polished white rice, so that they don’t end up with vitamin deficiencies.

White rice, like most starchy foods, has two kinds of starch molecules: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is a smaller, linear molecule, while amylopectin is larger and branched-out.
==========

- Your Highlight on page 46 | location 700-703 | Added on Saturday, 22 April 2023 02:08:40

It’s when water and heat are applied that the amylose breaks through to form a gel-like substance we associate with cooked starch. The percentage of amylose and amylopectin determine if a certain variety of rice will be sticky or have separate grains when cooked. Rice varieties with less than 20 per cent amylose (80 per cent amylopectin) tend to become a little sticky after cooking, while varieties with more than 20 per cent amylose tend to have separate grains.

When rice is cooked in hot water, a process called gelatinization happens. This is where starch molecules, which are made up of long chains of sugar molecules, break down and form cosy relationships with water molecules to create two kinds of textures—a hard and waxy texture from the amylose, and a sticky gooey texture from the amylopectin.
==========

The general, fail-safe algorithm to cook rice perfectly is: Wash away as much amylopectin as possible from the surface of the rice. This is the starch that becomes sticky when cooked. Wash rice till the water runs clear. Then add water to the rice and bring it to a boil. When the rice’s internal temperature hits 65oC, starches gelatinize. Don’t worry, you don’t have to poke a thermometer into a rice grain to accurately measure this. Just let the water visibly come to a boil, and the moment that happens you will know that all the starch in your rice has gelatinized. As the water comes to a boil, place a lid on your cooking vessel and reduce the heat to the lowest setting possible. At this point, we are simply letting the gelatinized starches absorb the rest of the water in the vessel. This takes about 15 minutes. Once all the water has visibly been absorbed, take your vessel off the stove and let it sit for 10 more minutes with the lid closed. At this point, a process called retrogradation happens, where each grain separates and creates its own identity, much like a teenager reading Ayn Rand. Once this is done, open the lid and fluff up the rice with a fork before serving.

Two of the hard-to-digest carbohydrates in legumes like kidney beans (rajma)—raffinose and stachyose—cannot be digested by our digestive systems efficiently and, thus, become food for the bacteria in our guts. They metabolize these carbohydrates and produce gas, causing a rather familiar discomfort and occasional wind production. Turns out, eating fart-producing beans is not a bad idea at all because it encourages the growth of a diverse colony of healthy gut bacteria, who are, in general, excellent tenants.

One of the hardest legumes to cook, the chickpea (chana), can be cooked to perfect softness if you add a pinch of baking soda to the pressure cooker. Baking soda (see Chapter 5) breaks down pectin, the hard substance that holds the plant’s cell walls together, and accelerates the cooking of chickpeas (or any other legume for that matter).

Lactobacteria on the surface of the dal and rice will, in the presence of water, cause fermentation, a behaviour exploited to make idlis, dosas and other lip-smacking items. Given that the weather is warm and humid all through the year in south India, fermentation is largely predictable and controllable.

Here is how you can make the perfect idli/dosa batter from scratch: Take parboiled rice and decorticated (sounds cooler than saying de-skinned) urad dal in a 4:1 ratio, and soak them separately in water. Rice will need at least six hours of soaking, while urad dal will require just two hours. Don’t oversoak the dal, or you will end up with a pasty texture in your idlis. Grind the rice and dal separately with a pinch of fenugreek seeds, which have been soaked for an hour, and salt till you get a smooth texture. Don’t over grind. Mix them together and let it ferment at room temperature. If you live in a colder place, heat up an oven, switch it off and then let it cool down to about 35oC before placing the batter inside. It will take between six and eight hours for the ideal amount of fermentation to happen before you can make idlis. The density of the batter will decrease as the bacteria eat the sugar in the rice and dal, and fart out carbon dioxide, which leavens the batter. Fermentation will also increase the amount of vitamin B in the batter and reduce its pH, thanks to the production of lactic acid that makes the batter mildly sour, a topic we shall explore in detail in Chapter 3. The amount of lactic acid will increase as the batter continues to ferment, which is why dosas are sourer than idlis and utthapams are the sourest of them all. After six to eight hours, refrigerate your batter if you don’t plan to use it right away. You can make idli on the first two days, and as fermentation continues slowly in the refrigerator, you can make dosas on the third and fourth days, and utthapam after that. Before using the batter, check its ‘pourability’. It should feel like melted ice cream. If it feels thicker, add more water.

The milling process (in a chakki, which is a set of two millstones used to grind grain into flour) used to make atta causes a fair bit of damage to the proteins and starches in the flour, which makes atta not an ideal flour to bake leavened bread. A loaf of bread baked with atta tends to be dense and crumbly, and not soft and airy like it is if you use the whole wheat flour available outside India. This is also why leavened breads, such as naan and kulcha, tend to use maida, which is not made using the stone-grinding process and, thus, has better gluten development when leavened.

The pentamenter line is the primary line used by the English poets not for any mysterious reason, but simply because the pentameter line most nearly matches the breath capacity of our English lungs—that is, speak-ing in English—and thus it is the line most free from any special effect.* It fits without stress, makes a full phrase, and leaves little breath at the end. It gives off, therefore, no particular message. It is, one might say, the norm.

The first foot of the line is the opposite of the iambic foot—the heavy stress comes first and is followed by a light stress. This is called a trochee. It is a wonderful and forceful way to begin a line.* It can be used any-where within a line also, replacing an iambic foot. Or, it may be the prevailing line, as in this familiar passage from Shakespeare's MacBeth: Double, double toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and, cauldron, bubble,

It is fascinating to see when Frost uses the iamb to begin a poem and when he chooses the trochee or dactyl. More often than not he uses an iamb when the poem begins with narration, and a trochee or dactyl (the more formal, "composed" sound) when the poem starts with dia-logue.

Consider the interior of the metrical line; there is a particularly effective device that can break into the established tempo of the line, thereby indicating—almost announcing—an important or revelatory moment. It is called the caesura. It is a structural and logical pause within and only within the line, and usually, but not always, within a metrical foot itself,

The rhyme occurring on the words "spears" and "tears" is called true rhyme. It is also a masculine rhyme: the words rhyme on a single stressed syllable. When the words are not true rhyming words (like pot and hot) but almost rhyme (like down and noon in the Emily Dickinson quotation on p. 41) it is called off-rhyme, or slant rhyme.

When, on the other hand, the poet enjambs the line— turns the line so that a logical phrase is inter-rupted—it speeds the line for two reasons: curiosity about the missing part of the phrase impels the reader to hurry on, and the reader will hurry twice as fast over the obstacle of a pause because it is there. We leap with more energy over a ditch than over no ditch.

Here is what happens when you add water to atta or maida. There are two proteins in wheat—glutenin and gliadin—that form a stretchy and elastic structure called gluten, which traps air to create give your finished bread a light and airy texture.

The algorithm for the perfect, soft chapatti dough is: Mix atta and water, and roughly bring it to a shaggy mix (no need to knead) till there are no dry bits of flour. Let it sit for 30 minutes. This triggers a process of autolysis where gluten formation starts in the presence of water. You can use slightly warm, but not boiling, water to increase gluten development. Boiling water will cook (gelatinize) the starches in the wheat, and that will leave less water for gluten development. Some methods do recommend using boiling water, but that will produce not just a soft chapatti but also an ultra-flaky one. Ultimately, it’s a matter of personal preference. I tend to like my chapattis with some amount of chew. The beauty of autolysis is that you don’t need to knead the dough at all. The dough will literally knead itself. After 30 minutes, work in some salt into the dough. We don’t add the salt up front because salt tends to tighten the gluten network, and we don’t want that during the early stage of gluten development. Just knead the dough mildly till it looks shiny and slick (the autolysis phase will help make this happen pretty quickly) and you are done! Think of all those instructions that ask you to knead the dough for 10 minutes. If you think the exercise will be useful for your deltoid, triceps and biceps, go ahead, but

A fascinating thing to think about is why organic vegetables tend to taste better than non-organic produce. As we just learnt, flavour tends to be a function of how strong the plant’s defence mechanisms against predatory munchers is. If a plant is exposed to more pests, it will use more of its resources to defend against them and, thus, be more flavourful for us. This is why non-organic produce, grown in sterile and pest-free environments, tends to be bigger and lacking in flavour.

One of the mechanisms a plant uses to sense insectile threats is to detect a substance called chitin. Chitin makes up the cell walls of several fungi and insects that attack plants. So, when a plant detects chitin, it goes into ninja mode and invests more in its defence budget. We can use this behaviour to trick the plant into thinking that there are pests nearby, by mixing powdered crustacean shells (like shrimps, which are closely related to insects) into the soil the plants are growing in. While we want the flavour that comes from plants operating in DEFCON 5 mode, we don’t actually want pests to eat the stuff we should be eating. The chitin in the soil does the trick. Some modern organic farms use this trick to produce delicious vegetables with a reduced risk of pest damage.

This is why the best way to cook leaves is to blanch them in boiling water for 30 seconds and then to remove them away from heat. If you need to use them in salads, you can also stop any further cooking by plunging them into a bowl filled with ice water. The application of high heat for a short period deactivates an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase that typically robs the chlorophyll molecule (the one that gives leaves their bright green colour) of its precious magnesium atom, causing the leaves to discolour into an unappetizing dull green. You can then puree the blanched greens and use it as you like. It will both look bright green and not taste too bitter. In general, high temperatures (around 85oC) for short periods of time are the best way to cook most vegetables to optimal taste and texture.

In general, steaming vegetables is a better approach than boiling them, especially if you are looking to retain most of the vegetable’s flavour and texture. It will take longer than boiling because, as we learnt earlier in this chapter, vapour is less dense than liquid water and, thus, takes more time to transfer heat. However, if the idea is to assault the vegetable with fifteen spices, ginger and garlic, then it doesn’t matter much. But if you are making a minimalist dry dish with a vegetable, it’s better to steam the vegetable to the right level of doneness, brown it in oil and then add spices, before quickly turning the stove off.

On the other hand, perfectly cooked meat is tender and moist when moderate heat, well below boiling point, is applied, causing the proteins to bind loosely to each other while still being able to retain water. If you overheat meat, and this is ridiculously easy to do, it will become tough and dry, and the proteins will bind to each other really tightly, squeezing all the moisture out.

Meat (and animal protein in general) is edible in a very narrow range of temperatures. Below 55oC it is uncooked and potentially harbours dangerous microbes, while above 65oC it becomes dry and chewy. And to make things more complicated, how long you need to cook meat will depend on which part of the animal is being cooked.

What does work in getting flavours into the meat is a process called brining. Letting meat sit in a salt solution, into which you can add other flavouring ingredients as well, will result in the salt getting into the meat, which by itself significantly improves the flavour. More magically, the salt prevents the loss of water from the muscle tissues in the meat. This is rather counter-intuitive because when you add salt to vegetables, they tend to lose water, and we tend to assume that salt is a dehydrating agent. Yes, it is, but only for plant cells. For animals, including humans, salt helps retain moisture. Think about what you do when you are dehydrated. You drink water (to replace the lost water), sugar (for instant energy) and salt, which helps you retain the water you just drank.

So, applying what we now know about how meat cooks, keeping it in a water bath at 39oC, will defrost your meat in 10–15 minutes without cooking it. Protein starts to denature around 50oC, so the idea is to get water as warm as you can while ensuring that it is circulated constantly to ensure even transfer to heat. A sous vide device will do this, but if you do not have one, heat water in a microwave, at a low setting for about a minute. Then use a temperature probe and wait till the water reaches around 40oC. Put your meat in it and keep stirring once in a while. Tap water in India is regularly in the 40–45oC range during summer, so you can use that, but make sure you use a lid (or cling wrap) to reduce exposure to air.

Like with meat, the best way to cook an egg is to use low heat. If you are scrambling an egg or making an omelette, the trick to getting the softest and fluffiest results is to salt the broken egg at least 15 minutes before you cook it. The salt will uncoil the proteins in the egg before they have the chance to set rapidly when heat is applied. This allows for a softer texture in your omelette or bhurji.

Fatty acids, both long and short ones, have two kinds of bonds between the carbon bonds—a single bond or a double bond. When there is a double bond, there are fewer hydrogen atoms, as the carbon bonds once more with carbon instead of with the hydrogen in the fatty acid. When all the bonds in the fatty acid are single bonds, the fatty acid is saturated (with Hydrogen). When one of the bonds is a double bond, it’s a monounsaturated fatty acid. When there are more than one carbon double bonds, it’s a polyunsaturated fatty acid. Each fat molecule could have any combination of three saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Any oil that has a higher percentage of saturated fatty acids is more likely to be solid at room temperature. Think of butter, ghee, coconut oil and animal fat (lard). Any oil that has more unsaturated fatty acids is likely to be liquid at room temperature. Think of groundnut, mustard or sunflower oil. Because solids are easier to transport, the fat industry has, over the years, tried to convert cheaper sources of oil (typically from plants) that tend to have more unsaturated fatty acids into solids. This is done by forcing hydrogen into those fatty acids and turning the double carbon bonds into single bonds through a process that we should be familiar with, thanks to the label on Dalda—hydrogenation.

So, how do rogue fatty acids break free of the glycerol? Light, water and oxygen. Light tends to act as a catalyst for the rebellious behaviour of fatty acids, and when you deep-fry something in hot oil, you are essentially dropping something with a ton of water into fat.

But there is a sizeable section of the population that has a visceral aversion to coriander (4–14 per cent depending on their ancestry) in its leaf form. It turns out that it’s not an irrational personal choice but genetics. Coriander’s flavour molecules are a family of compounds called aldehydes, and the ones present in coriander are also found in soap. Some people have a gene (or a combination of genes, we don’t know fully) that makes their taste buds specifically sensitive to aldehydes, so eating coriander leaves strongly reminds them of soap.

But what’s interesting is that when you crush coriander leaves, or grind them into a paste, an enzymatic reaction breaks down these soapy aldehydes, which is why people who can’t tolerate the leaves as a garnish don’t mind coriander chutney in their chaats

Flavour is a combination of taste, smell, mouthfeel, and to a smaller extent, sound and visual experiences. And despite the fact that 80 per cent of flavour perception happens in the nose, we tend to associate the tongue as being the Watson and Crick of flavour to the nose’s Rosalind Franklin.

Bitter tastes come from substances called alkaloids such as caffeine (in coffee), theobromine (in chocolate), quinine (in tonic water), and so on. Our ability to detect bitterness comes from the need to identify poisons before we ingest them.

It turns out that taste buds operate at their peak between 20oC and 30oC. This is why coffee is tolerable at 50–60oC, which is usually the temperature at which it is served, while it tastes bitter once it gets to room temperature, which tends to be the temperature range in which our taste buds operate at their peak.

What you smell before you eat is called orthonasal olfaction, and what you smell as a result of a ton of volatile flavour molecules hitting those receptors as you breathe out is retronasal olfaction. This, in my opinion, is the single largest contributor to taste, because the act of chewing releases the maximum amount of volatile aroma molecules from your food.

This is why many foods that smell funny taste amazing once they are in the mouth. A good example is cheese. Many older Indians find the funky smell of cheese off-putting. This is because what you smell before you eat the cheese is the overwhelming smell of the ketones and aldehydes in it. Once you chew it, the complex molecules generated by the slow fermentation process start to hit your nose retronasally, and that’s when you go ‘ah, cheese’.

Since our saliva contains 0.4 per cent salt by concentration, any food with less than 0.4 per cent salt by weight will taste unseasoned. So, 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent by weight is a sensible starting point for estimating how much salt you need in your dish.

Iodide salts tend to break down at high temperatures and lend an acrid metallic taste to food. You will not notice this when making gravies because the temperature is not going to exceed 100oC in those cases, but you will notice it when you deep-fry or bake food in an oven. This is why it is recommended to use non-iodized salt when baking or deep-frying food. By the way, the processed food industry usually never uses iodized salt for this reason.

Adding potatoes, balls of rice or dough don’t really reduce salt concentration. All they do is absorb the gravy and leave you with less gravy overall. You can add sugar or an acid (like lime juice) to change the perception of saltiness, but that won’t move the needle by much. What does work is adding more unsalted stock (or just plain water), but that will dilute your dish.

When cooking, an important salt behaviour to keep in mind is that while it dehydrates vegetables, it prevents moisture loss in meats. Adding salt when cooking vegetables will cook them faster and adding salt to raw vegetables will cause them to lose water. But if you let meat sit in a salt solution for a few hours before cooking, it will remain tender and moist after cooking. This magic trick, which we discussed briefly in the previous chapter on the science of meat, is absolutely key to preventing meat from drying out during the cooking process.

Here’s a quick cheat sheet on the rules of salt: Salt balances sweetness by elevating other flavours in desserts. Take your dessert game to the next level by always adding a pinch of salt when making something like payasam or kheer. You will not be disappointed. Salt mutes sourness. This is a trick commonly used to salvage overly sour yoghurt by serving it with a pinch of salt. Salt mutes bitterness. This tip is very useful when cooking green leafy vegetables or bitter gourd. Salt dehydrates plant material. This is an excellent trick to improve the flavour of salad ingredients. Salt helps meat retain moisture. You must always consider brining meat before marinating or cooking it.

Incidentally, not all sugars taste sweet. Sucrose is the one that is most familiar because it makes up the crystalline sugar we use every single day. Sucrose by itself is made up of two other sugars—glucose and fructose—that got together, shook hands, agreed to lose a water molecule and bonded together.

Here are some simple rules for sweetness as a taste: Sweet mutes saltiness up to a point, and also mutes sourness and bitterness. You can use it to balance these flavours. Sweetness adds depth to other flavours, such as spices. When you bite into a cardamom, you will smell it, but it will taste bitter. When you bite into cardamom with a pinch of sugar, the aroma and taste of cardamom will seem stronger.

your mouth has TRPV1 receptors, which trigger panic bells when a few things happen. One of them is when you bite into a hot samosa that you think has cooled down. The second is when you imbibe something with very low pH levels, essentially highly acidic things. The TRPV1 receptors detect high temperatures and strong acids in the mouth, and here is where the genius of the chilli plant comes into play.

Mustard (allyl isothiocyanate), ginger (gingerol) and black pepper (piperine) also produce molecules that can trigger these receptors. By the way, you can desensitize this receptor by continuing to eat more chillies. Eventually, like the villagers in the story about the boy who cried wolf, they will not ring alarm bells every single time.

In simpler terms, the pain of eating chillies is also pleasurable, and since the capsaicin is only creating the illusion of heat, it does no permanent damage unless you eat a ton of chillies. And the release of endorphins while you are eating makes the rest of the food taste way more delicious than it is. This is why we are addicted to hot food.

Like with most spices, chillies (both green and red) lose their flavour once they are powdered. They do not, however, lose heat because capsaicin is not volatile. If you want the flavour of the chillies, use them whole. If you only want heat, use the powder.

If you are sensitive to heat, a common misconception is that it’s the seeds that contribute all the heat. They don’t. The seeds are removed because they taste bitter. It’s the placenta, which connects the seeds to the flesh, that has most of the capsaicin. So, removing that will reduce the heat levels in your chillies.

A key thing to remember is that the flavours of spices work only in combination with the following seven basic elements: Salt: Amplifies spice flavours Sweet: Amplifies spice flavours Bitter: Many spices by themselves have a bitter taste, but they also have a strong aroma that our noses detect Sour: Balances spice flavours and makes multiple flavours stand out Umami: Makes spice flavours linger in the mouth Heat: Makes spice flavours pleasurable Fat: Transports flavour. Most flavour molecules are not water-soluble. If not for fat, most flavours would simply be lost to the air.

The flavour of a spice in a dish depends on: How you mechanically damage it: Cut, chop, smash, mince, grind, etc. How you cook it: Dry-roast, oil-roast, boil in water, etc. How long you cook it: In general, the longer you cook, the lesser the intensity of the flavour of spices, but this is a tricky concept. When you cook a gravy for a long time, the amount of water will reduce, which will increase the concentration of spices in your dish, thus making it taste more intense. So, it’s important to understand this distinction. The intensity of a single spice’s flavour will reduce with cooking, as more aroma molecules are lost to the air, while the dish in totality might taste more intense because it is becoming thicker. What you pair it with, in terms of acid, fat, salt and sugar.

And for each of these four categories of spices, these are the methods available to mechanically damage them to release flavour: Dry spices (black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, clove) Use whole, as we do with mustard and cumin, for a mild flavour Coarsely ground them for medium amount of flavour Finely powder them to extract the maximum amount of flavour. However, these have short shelf lives because powders leak volatile aroma molecules very quickly. Dry herbs (fenugreek or dried mint) They are already flaky and powdery, so at best, crush them before use (like fenugreek) to help extract more flavours. Fresh spices (garlic and ginger) Use large pieces for the mildest flavour Roughly chop for medium flavour Mince for medium high flavour Use a paste for maximum flavour Fresh herbs (coriander or curry leaves) Use whole for mild flavour Roughly chop for medium flavour Mince for medium to high flavour Use a paste for maximum flavour, but remember that the leaves tend to have enzymes that will start degrading flavour the moment any damage happens. So, use right away or use the trick described in Chapter 1, where you blanch it for 30 seconds and shock it in an ice bath before grinding into a paste.

Fresh spices, such as ginger and garlic, can be used to impart a wide range of flavour intensity based on how they are cut and cooked. Roughly chopped garlic will have a milder flavour than the paste, but garlic cooked from the start of the dish will taste milder than garlic that is added towards the end. So, in the dishes that you do want a strong garlicky flavour, add it closer to the end, but only use roughly chopped or whole garlic cloves instead of the paste, so that you do not overwhelm the dish.

Fresh herbs are the most delicate of them all and, in general, best added right at the end of the cooking process, although curry leaves, which have a very intense flavour, do tend to survive long cooking and still impart their characteristic citrusy and meaty flavour to a dish. But the best cooks, when making dishes that use curry leaves at the start, will also add some fresh leaves at the end so that you get a hint of the fresh flavour as well.

Raw whole spices + no heat: Little or no flavour. Crushed spices + little or no heat: Medium flavour, like cardamom powder added at the end of payasam of kheer. Crushed spices in water + heat: Mild flavour, like cardamom or ginger in tea. Whole spices + oil + long cooking + medium heat: Moderate flavour, like using panch phoran or mustard/cumin at the start of a dish. Roasted whole spices + crushing + oil + low heat: Maximum flavour. Powdered spices + oil + high heat: Causes burning, so please avoid. Use low heat instead. Oil-roasted whole spices + crushing: Don’t cook for too long. Best added at the end of a dish. Whole spices + oil + high heat: Mild flavour. This is the idea of the tadka (tempering). It’s not to overwhelm the dish with last-minute flavour but to add a whiff of it by using high heat, which destroys most of the aroma molecules but leaves behind just enough.

To summarize, if you want to extract more flavour: Roast dry spices. Mince or grind fresh spices into a paste. If using the spices whole, add them at the start of the cooking process. If using a powder, use it towards the end of the cooking process. You will see a ton of cooking videos on YouTube that add a ton of roasted cumin powder at the start of the dish. You are better off adding a much smaller amount of this spice towards the end and achieving a similar effect. Use fresh or dry herbs only at the end of the cooking process. Spices cooked in oil will taste more intense than spices boiled in water.

get a mortar and pestle made of granite too, since it offers the most amount of abrasive firepower to crush spices. A mortar and pestle will extract more flavour from fresh spices, such as garlic and ginger, because the high-speed blade of a blender ends up heating and partially cooking the spice.

Let’s recap the twelve categories of flavours in spices: Sweet, warming phenols: Clove and fennel Warming terpenes: Nutmeg and mace Fragrant terpenes: Coriander Sweet-and-sour acids: Amchoor Fruity aldehydes: Sumac Toasty pyrazines: When any spice is dry-roasted Earthy terpenes: Cumin and nigella Penetrating terpenes: Cardamom Citrus terpenes: Lemongrass Sulphurous and meaty: Garlic, black salt, mustard, asafoetida and curry leaves Pungent: Chilli, black pepper and ginger Complex flavour: Saffron, turmeric and fenugreek You can also refer to the table of flavours we saw just a while ago. Pick one or two flavour categories, the ones you want to be dominant in your mix. Pick a spice from each category. For each of those spices, pick one more spice (from any category) that shares at least one flavour molecule. For example, if you picked black pepper, your second spice should be black cardamom, which too has pinene. Black pepper and black cardamom will work well together as they will reinforce the woody/camphorous notes of pinene. Of course, nothing stops you from adding more spices to your mix, but remember that the more you add, the less your mix will stand out, as too many flavours will make your dish taste intense without necessarily being unique. Like the instant noodles masala.

French physician and chemist Louis-Camille Maillard was the first to describe what exactly was happening to the proteins and starches in the cooking vessel. It’s been about a 100 years and we are still in the process of describing what happens when you cook food at temperatures above 110oC. It is precisely this spectacular diversity of chemical reactions that lend the seemingly infinite range of flavours to food all around the world. We shall begin exploring this magical browning reaction with the humble onion.

For starters, food science now tells us that the more flavourful, and correspondingly more tear-inducing, parts of the onion are the outer layers, not the inner ones. So, the next time you chop onions keep this in mind before callously discarding too many of the outer layers.

Then there is a purple variant, which is great for use in salads but is not as flavourful as the yellow one. It is truly a testament to the sophistication of various cuisines in India that we make do with what is ultimately a substandard variety of onion and coax the most amazing flavours out of it. But this is a rather recurrent theme in Indian home cooking.

When you cut an onion across the bulb, and not along it, you break the cells, which release, after a chain of reactions that takes about thirty seconds after mechanical damage to the cells, an aerosol of syn-Propanethial-S-oxide, a sulphur-based chemical that immediately causes the lachrymose (tear) glands to fight back by generating tears to flush the irritant chemical out.

You could refrigerate the onions for a little bit before cutting them. Don’t store onions in the fridge for long though because they need well-ventilated spaces, and fridges are not exactly ventilated. The science trick here is that if you remember your high-school biology, most cellular reactions require at least body temperature (37oC, or 98.6oF), so briefly chilling the onion before cutting it will significantly reduce the rate of that enzyme reaction.

The more mechanical damage you do to the onion, the more MMP is released, and thus more intense the flavour in your dish. It is also fairly water-soluble, so adding a bit of water after sautéing the onions will get you a stronger flavour, as it will prevent any further loss of aroma to the air.

If you are using an onion for a salad and will be eating it raw, just soak it in water for a bit to remove most of the pungency. If you want your salad onions to remain crunchy, don’t use warm or hot water, as the heat will break down cell walls and turn the onions limp.

As mentioned earlier, the inner layers of an onion are less pungent and flavourful than the outer layers. So, think twice before discarding too many of the outer layers. Incidentally, the enzyme reactions we just spoke about continue well after you cut an onion. They don’t just stop because, at room temperature, the enzymes are still active. This is why it’s not a good idea to cut onions in advance. They will lose flavour and also develop a slightly bitter taste, as the enzyme reactions continue unabated. Cut them as close to the cooking time as possible. If this is not practical, consider refrigerating after you cut them.

In general, you don’t want to slow-heat oil because it will only oxidize more. You also don’t want to add your onions before the oil is hot because adding anything to oil lowers its temperature. Another science tip to remember: You want to heat the oil to something way less than 177oC, which is ‘frying’ temperature. We are not frying onions at this point, although that is a perfectly valid thing to do if you are making biryani.

An interesting fact: The amino acids in your own cells react with sugars over time, in a very slow version of the Maillard reaction, to render proteins in your tissues dysfunctional, which, scientists say, is a component of human ageing! Imagine the irony in the fact that the same reaction that makes your onions delicious is also the reaction that slowly kills you. This is also why doctors keep telling you to keep your blood sugar levels low.

It turns out that you can pressure-caramelize onions! All you have to do is add butter, salt and onions to a pressure cooker and cook it for 20 minutes at peak pressure. The onions have enough water in them, so you don’t need to add more water. If you are nervous, go ahead and add a teaspoon just to soothe your anxiety from trying water-free pressure-cooking. The butter will, in any case, prevent the onions from getting scorched.

Baking soda accelerates the breakdown of pectin, which in turn releases the proteins and sugars inside the onion. These, when heated up, undergo the Maillard reaction. As long as the pectin holds, it will guard the innards of as many onion cells as possible with great dedication.

If you cook your onions till they are translucent, they will impart a mild flavour to your dish. I’d use this for milder, creamier curries, like kormas, etc. Mildly browned onions will impart a complex sweet and savoury flavour, suitable for tikka masala-type strong-flavoured gravies. If you go all the way to golden brown, the onions become suitable for bhuna (roasted), rogan josh or theeyal-type dishes. If you go all the way and caramelize them, you might as well just go ahead and smear it on a piece of toast and wonder what you’ve been missing out on all these years.

But browning garlic is very tricky business because the line between getting good flavours from the Maillard reaction and nasty, bitter flavours because of burning is very slim. This is one reason why it’s generally safe to avoid browning garlic when it’s part of a more complex dish, because the chances that it will add bitter flavours to your dish is very high, unless your nose is finer than the one on a French sommelier.

A simple rule of thumb: When you add garlic to a pan, always keep the heat at medium–low. And if you observe your grandmother, she will likely add the garlic only after the onion. The reason for this is that onion, which has more water, releases it into the pan, which keeps the garlic from burning.

A whole bulb of garlic (mind you, cloves of garlic will likely burn), drizzled with some oil, wrapped in aluminium foil in a 175oC oven, which is the temperature at the end of the Maillard reaction chain, for 30 minutes will yield spectacularly caramelized garlic which, when added to butter, makes for the most satisfying garlic butter you will ever taste. The papery outer layers of the garlic bulb and the individual cloves will mostly be burnt at the end of 30 minutes. In fact, it serves as an additional layer of protection to prevent the flavourful innards from burning.

knowledge of the Maillard reaction to make the perfect, golden-roasted potato by simply adding a pinch of baking soda to the vessel in which you are boiling the chopped potato. Baking soda will break down the pectin on the outer layers and create ridges and grooves that, when encountering hot oil, will turn into the most scrumptious and crisp exterior, even as the insides remain perfectly soft and cooked.

So, here’s the biggest food science tip for the Indian kitchen, albeit one that restaurants use all the time and good cooks just seem to know. Consider browning as many ingredients as possible before adding them to gravies, if you truly want the most delicious flavours. A simple example: Roasting pumpkins in an oven, or on a grill, before using them to make pumpkin soup makes for a significantly more delicious soup than simply boiling them in a broth. You can use this principle in any dish you wish to make, for example, cauliflower gravy. Lightly steaming the cauliflower and then browning it in butter before adding it to a tomato-based gravy will yield a distinctly superior-tasting final product than simply dropping the cauliflower into the gravy

What is useful for us though is to understand what the actual caramelization reaction really is. Unlike the Maillard reaction, which happens between amino acids and sugars, caramelization happens to sugars when they are heated to a very high temperature. When you heat onions at low heat for a really long time, you will eventually get to the point where both the Maillard reaction and caramelization of sugar happen, but that is dangerously close to burning territory, so be very careful. The more you actually caramelize the sugars in the onions, the sweeter they will taste.

This is why the vada batter must have as little water as possible. If it has too much water, the outside will take a long time to dehydrate, resulting in vadas that are overly dark brown with a thick crust. An important thing to remember: You can’t fry something that does not have both sugars and proteins. This is why you need a batter when frying something like chicken or pakoras. The batter is usually made using a starch, such as rice, wheat, corn or gram flour. You can also use breadcrumbs, which stick to whatever it is you are deep-frying, using eggs.

Of course, many things could go wrong. Let’s take a puri. If the oil is not hot enough, the exterior will not dehydrate fast enough to become non-porous quickly. In that time, hot oil will seep into the puri and make it greasy and heavy. If the oil is too hot, the outer crust will brown too fast and the heat will not have enough time to cook the insides, giving you a raw doughy taste. Another thing to keep in mind is that hot oil oxidizes, and oxidized oil tastes nasty. This is why reusing frying oil is not recommended, however, if you filter for particles and prevent further oxidation by storing it in a dark place, you can use it again. One way in which you can reduce the amount of oxidation during frying is to use a narrower frying vessel, like the smallest kadai that fits your food. That will expose less of the hot oil to the air than a larger kadai. Also, fry in smaller batches. You can also add a pinch of baking soda to the batter of whatever it is you are frying. Alkaline conditions accelerate the Maillard reaction and will result in more even browning.

If you don’t eat fried food right away, it will go limp. This happens because even after you take it out of the frying pan, it continues to lose moisture. If you don’t provide an avenue for it to escape, it will settle on the surface of your fried chicken and make it soggy. The trick is to store freshly fried food at a temperature just short of the boiling point of water, so that no further cooking happens and it is easy for moisture to evaporate and keep things crisp. An oven at 93oC (200oF) will do the trick.

Every sour ingredient is essentially an acid. In fact, the word acid literally comes from the Latin word acidus, which means ‘sour’. To varying degrees of sourness, yoghurt, lemons, pineapples, tamarind, grapes and vinegar are culinary acids.

Here’s how sourness affects other flavours: Sourness reduces bitterness: A squeeze of lemon into your spinach dishes will mute any residual bitterness in the cooked leaves. If you recall Chapter 1, leaves tend to turn bitter when cooked for too long. But be careful, acids can also decolourize green vegetables, so use them towards the end of the cooking process. Sourness balances spice flavours by doing what an equalizer does in music. In dishes that have many strong flavours, adding an acid will create space for every individual flavour and make them stand out. Sourness minimizes the perception of fattiness and makes food feel less heavy and rich. If you feel that you’ve used a bit too much oil in your dish, a good way to reduce the perception of greasiness is to add some acid (like lime juice) at the end. Sourness can balance overly sweet dishes. A good shrikhand is an example of this. If not for the sour tang of the yoghurt, it can be cloyingly sweet.

When we cook meat, we use heat to denature proteins, causing them to become tougher. Another technique used with meat is marinating it in an acid. Any kebab is usually marinated in some acid, typically a mixture of yoghurt and lime juice. Now, the Internet (and many cookbooks) will tell you that acids make the meat more tender, but they don’t! Acids break up protein structures and cause them to reassemble in bigger meshes, which actually makes the meat tougher. But in doing so, the acids allow the mesh to absorb other flavourful molecules in the marinade, like ginger, garlic and garam masala. By the way, all of this happens only on the surface of the meat. So, anyone telling you that the marinade penetrates deeper the longer you marinate is simply lying.

Marination attaches flavours to the outer layers of whatever it is that you are marinating. Another tip to marinating effectively: Beat the hell out of the meat with a tenderizing hammer, which will create more surface area for the marinade to operate on. And use small pieces of meat. Avoid using over-acidic marinades, as they will cook the meat. If you want to take your kebabs to the next level, brine your meat for a few hours, and then marinate in spices and acid for about an hour. Twenty-four-hour marinades don’t do much, other than cooking your meat in acid.

So, never overheat yoghurt. Always add it later in the cooking process. However, if you are making a gravy that is yoghurt-based, and need to cook it for a fair bit of time, the trick is to use some starch like corn flour, rice flour, wheat flour or gram flour (besan) and whisk it into the yoghurt to strengthen the emulsion, thus keeping it from breaking down when heated. This is the key to dishes like kadhi, morkozhambu and pulisheri.

In general, tamarind water-based gravies will need 6–8 minutes of medium heat to bring the sourness down to an acceptable level. Start from there and then decide if you need less or more cook time. Contemporary chefs who work with food scientists have determined that the pH of a good, balanced dish tends to be in the range of 4.3 to 4.9.

Tamarind has a meaty, savoury base flavour that works well when cooked, sort of like a drummer and bass guitarist put together. Amchoor has a fruity, bright, sour flavour that works best when not cooked too much, like a lead guitarist. Citrus juices, which we shall discuss now, are like the lead vocalists who are usually in your face.

The terpenes in it (Chapter 2) will get oxidized, which will then develop a well-rounded taste. So, if you are making nimbu paani, lemon rice or jal jeera, squeeze the limes well ahead of time. If you are using it just as an acid, don’t bother. Just squeeze it straight into the dish. Also, don’t try this trick with oranges—they will taste off if exposed to air for long.

Ketchup will improve any red-coloured gravy. For special occasions, especially when making gravies where tomato is the star, say a paneer makhani, you can apply the flavour-layering principles outlined so far. Use fresh tomatoes, tomato paste (or ketchup) and dehydrated tomato powder to get the most intense, layered flavour.

Alcoholic drinks are also acidic, which is why cooking with wine or beer is common in the West. But given the general tendency to keep alcohol at an arm’s length in Indian homes, this technique is not very common in the country. If you have some old wine lying around, try this when making gravies: After you sauté the spices in oil, cook onions, ginger and garlic, add a splash of the wine into the pan. This will deglaze all the lovely tasting brown bits (Maillard reaction, remember), extract more flavour from the spices and, while at it, add sourness.

One of the rather effective things they did was to invent a family of molecules called alkaloids, which tend to be poisonous for animals. That is not to say that the animals sat around munching on poison and dropping dead in large numbers; they figured out ways of detecting poisonous plants before ingesting them, which helped us hone our perception of bitter tastes. Since alkaloids tend to be bitter, our tongues evolved a mechanism to detect these (at the back of the mouth). This mechanism causes a nasty aftertaste to linger in our mouths, causing us to spit out what we are eating, potentially saving us a gruesome death by poison.

All things alkaline, which by the way are not related to alkaloids, tend to taste bitter, in that they activate the same receptors. So, over millions of years of evolution, our digestive systems have developed a bias towards acidic foods.

The Acid Cheat Sheet Here’s a simple guide for you: Acids add brightness to food, while balancing other flavours, particularly spices. Acids cause us to salivate. The processed food industry takes advantage of this weakness of ours to make what is nutritionally terrible food taste delicious. And since adding acids balances the saltiness and sweetness, it allows them to cram more salt and sugar than is good for us into the snacks. This is not to deny that they taste delicious as a result. Acids tenderize meat, in that they break down the protein structures that help flavour molecules attach themselves to the surface. However, strong-enough acids toughen meat, so use them in moderation. Acids also cause plant cell walls to toughen up by bonding with the pectin, which is why cooking lentils with acids (such as tomatoes or tamarind) takes longer. A good way to use acids is to layer them, as you might do with spices (recall Chapter 2). In dishes like fish curry, sambar or kadhi, the acid is the anchor, while in dishes like dal, acids are the accent on top. You can layer acids by using different ones at various stages of the cooking process. Chaat, as described earlier, is a fantastic exemplar of acid layering—tamarind and tomatoes act as the base, while amchoor and lime juice, and occasionally pomegranates, are the accents. And remember what heat (capsaicin) does to flavour perception. Chaat, being hot, also results in an endorphin rush that makes the overall eating experience more pleasurable. Coca-Cola is more acidic than vinegar. As much as nine teaspoons of sugar in one can of the beverage is what makes it palatable. If you add so much sugar to vinegar, it will taste pretty decent too. Liquid acids preserve anything stored in them because bacteria don’t like living in acidic conditions. Interestingly, some microorganisms use this as a trick to keep competing critters out. Yeast and yoghurt bacteria produce lactic acid, which makes the fermented product too acidic for other fungi and bacteria. This is why fermentation works. If it was a free-for-all for every microbe out there, it would be called spoiling and not fermentation. You can take a good dish and add an acid to make it an amazing dish.

It turns out that combining glutamates with IMP or GMP has a greater-than-sum-of-parts effect. Essentially, adding both will result in an intensity of flavour that is a lot more than what you might expect by adding them individually.

The Japanese combine kombu (that has glutamates) with bonito flakes (that are made from tuna and have IMP) to make dashi stock, which forms the base for a lot of Japanese dishes. The Italians combine parmesan cheese and tomatoes, which are also quite rich in glutamates. The Japanese, in particular, have a cuisine centred around umami, which amplifies all other flavours, whereas Indian and Middle-Eastern cuisines are centred around fats and oils, which primarily transport flavour molecules. This is also why Japanese cooking is rather minimalistic. With umami as the base, you can make dishes using very few ingredients and yet get tremendous depth of flavour. Umami makes other flavours come a long way.

Monosodium glutamate (MSG), is umami in its purest form. There is no chemical difference between the glutamates in cabbage, mushrooms and tomato, and the half teaspoon of Ajinomoto that you sprinkle on fried rice. If you think MSG is bad for you, you might want to let every nursing mother know. After all, breast milk is exceedingly high in glutamates (at least ten times the amount of glutamates than regular cow milk).

For instance, we now know that in addition to having a separate taste receptor for umami, it looks like glutamates (and its compatriot nucleotides IMP and GMP) may be causing a phenomenon where other taste receptors, particularly salt and sweet, stay activated for longer periods of time than they would have in the absence of glutamates. This explains the lingering aspect of umami, where it causes other strong tastes to last longer on the tongue. Since umami amplifies saltiness and sweetness, a good way to reduce your salt and sugar intake is to use MSG, which, in addition to adding umami, is only about one-third as salty as common salt

The reasons why umami is classified as a separate taste are still open for discussion. One theory being explored is that it evolved as a mechanism for the tongue to detect protein-rich foods that are healthy.

A pinch of baking soda in the water you boil peeled potatoes in will break down the pectin, resulting in rough, jagged surfaces with significantly more surface area for crisping. Next, sauté these potatoes to get the most amazingly crunchy texture and golden brown colour. You can also use a pinch of baking soda while blanching green vegetables. This will keep the vegetables green, as the baking soda will prevent the breakdown of chlorophyll, which gives the vegetables their characteristic colour. Don’t cook them for too long though because the baking soda’s assault on pectin can turn your vegetables to mush.

Baking soda can also tenderize tough cuts of meat. If you recall Chapter 1, a common misconception is that using acids in a marinade helps make the meat tender. They do not. On the contrary, acids make meat tougher. Bases, on the other hand, can make it tender. If you add a pinch of baking soda to tough cuts of meat, like beef or mutton, and let it sit for 5 minutes, it will make the meat tender. But don’t add too much or you will be left with a nasty aftertaste.

Remember, you smell cardamom, you don’t taste it. What you taste when you bite into cardamom is its woody mouthfeel and bitter taste. This is why fats are absolutely crucial to cooking, because most flavour molecules are fat-soluble, not water-soluble. This means that when you cook spices in hot oil, it extracts all of these flavour molecules and dissolves them into the oil, thus preventing them from being lost to the air. When you eat this food, the enzymes in your saliva start breaking down the fats, which results in those dissolved aroma molecules escaping into your mouth. As they enter the short, shared highway that transports both food and air, the act of breathing out elevates the aroma molecules, which are basically gases, and makes them hit the olfactory receptors. That is when you truly experience the complex taste of the thousands of aroma molecules from the saffron in your biryani.

Here is how I use alcohol when making Indian dishes: A splash of vodka, brandy or rum when cooking onions, ginger, garlic, tomatoes and spice powders has two benefits: extraction of more flavour from the spices and the alcohol’s ability to release all those sticky bits from the bottom of the pan, which have a ton of flavour thanks to the Maillard reaction. A splash of wine added at the end of a dish, along with finishing spices, will amplify the effect of those spices when you eat. Keep in mind that while a small amount of alcohol can amplify flavour, a large amount will actually prevent the release of flavour molecules by holding on to them like family heirlooms. This is incidentally one of the reasons why bar snacks tend to be overpoweringly spicy in India. When had with a large whisky, that mirchi bajji could well be made using bhut jolokia chillies and you won’t notice. The amount of alcohol in beer is not strong enough to make a difference, so at the very least, use wine. The cheapest one will do because once heated, all the evocative notes of strawberries and smoked salmon in your fine Chardonnay will largely be destroyed. You can, however, use beer as an acid (see Chapter 4). If you are frying fish (or vegetables) using a batter, try a batter made of maida, salt and vodka (which is just plain ethanol diluted in water). What the alcohol does is reduce gluten development, which we do not want in a fried product, as it will cause chewiness. It also prevents surface starches from absorbing too much water to gelatinize, which will result in a drier and crispier crust. This technique was pioneered by Heston Blumenthal, who went one step further and carbonated his batter before use. The aerated batter makes the crust airy, in addition to being crisp. Trust me, use this technique and you will have some game-changing pakoras to enjoy.

Here’s a quick microwave cheat sheet: You can cook any ingredient that has water in it. Most vegetables will cook in 3–4 minutes at high power (high power on your microwave is most likely the default setting, but do check the manual to learn how to change the power setting). You can coat them with a little bit of oil, and spices, to infuse some flavours too. You can melt butter to perfect, spreadable consistency by reducing the power to half. At the default high-power setting, the water in the butter will turn to steam and break the emulsion, leaving you with translucent butter that is not very spreadable.

4. You can also collect the malai (cream) that floats on top of milk every day. Once you have enough, just put it in a tall microwave-safe vessel (so that it does not overflow) and microwave it for 7–8 minutes. You will get ghee once you filter the brown milk protein. 5. If you crave chickpeas one day but forgot to soak them, worry not. Simply microwave the chana in water for 20 minutes (at a low power setting) and then let it sit for another 20 minutes in the same hot water. You will have chana that is as good as the one soaked for eight hours. Pressure-cook it and use it as you please. 6. You can also dry fresh herbs and turn them into powder in the microwave oven. Do this for curry leaves and mint, which usually have a very short shelf life, even when refrigerated. 7. Let’s say you crave some rice late at night (who doesn’t!), but who wants to cook a single portion in the pressure cooker and then have to clean all the vessels. What if I tell you that you can make instant pulao in the microwave just by adding some ghee, whole spices, washed rice, salt and water. Simply let it microwave for 10 minutes at high power, and then 10–15 more minutes on a low setting, and it will be done. If you remember the method to cook rice perfectly from Chapter 1, the first step is about gelatinizing starches, which happens at about 80°C. The second step is about lowering the temperature and letting the gelatinized starches absorb water till they become nice and soft. That’s exactly what we are doing here too. Once done, squeeze some lime juice, because acids improve everything, and if you want to take it to the next level, sprinkle some MSG or mushroom powder for the umami hit. A caveat: don’t try to feed your entire family. Remember how microwaves have 12 cm wavelengths and create dead spots? Using a large amount of rice risks uncooked or undercooked portions being left in some places, so this method is ideal only for a single serving.

We already learned about one of them (blanching greens for 30 seconds and then shocking them in an ice bath to deactivate the enzyme responsible for stealing the magnesium from chlorophyll). But even this will keep your chutney green for a few hours at best. Enter our second modernist ingredient, sodium bisulphite. A really tiny pinch of this will keep your greens looking bright for a really long time. This molecule prevents most enzymatic browning (caused by polyphenol oxidase) and non-enzymatic browning (caused by good old oxygen). Added bonus: It is also a preservative that will prevent fridge-friendly fungi and bacteria from dipping into your chutneys.

To understand what it does, let’s understand what emulsification is. Typically, fats and water do not mix. But when you have a phospholipid, which is a fat molecule with a phosphate group attached to the glycerol backbone, in addition to the long fatty acid chains (recall Chapter 1), it allows the molecule to do something interesting—the phosphate side of the molecule binds with water, while the fatty acids like to hang out with their oil friends. So, when you introduce an emulsifier to a mixture of water and fat, and mechanically agitate it, it will turn into a creamy emulsion, like mayonnaise. Lecithin is a phospholipid found naturally in egg yolks and soy lecithin is simply lecithin produced from soybeans. You can use it to make super-stable salad dressings and also increase the shelf life of anything you bake in an oven. By the way, phospholipids are how our bodies digest and transports fats. We are mostly water, and fats don’t mix with water, so the phospholipids in our intestines emulsify fats (literally like mayonnaise) to be able to transport them easily.

The charcoal smoke flavour does not come from the charcoal; it comes from the fats in your food dripping on to the hot charcoal and breaking up into several highly aromatic compounds, which then waft up with the smoke and attach themselves to the food. On the other hand, wood is made up of cellulose and hemicellulose, with lignin acting as a glue of sorts. Cellulose and hemicellulose are carbohydrates, essentially made up of long chains of simpler sugar molecules.

Here is how you can make the most amazing modernist chicken tikka with breast meat, which is the most frustrating cut to deal with because it overcooks way too quickly. We shall apply all the science lessons we have learnt so far, turning it into a useful recap. Brine the chicken pieces in a solution of salt, dry spices and water. A 5–10 per cent salt solution will work. Try various levels in between to arrive at what works for you. You will need to do this for two hours for every 1 kg of chicken. Once you are done, wash it in plain water. Now, marinate the brined chicken in ginger and garlic paste, a little bit of salt, garam masala, chilli powder, turmeric, oil and yoghurt in a bowl for about an hour. Place a small cup in the bowl, drop in a piece of charcoal heated for at least five minutes and pour a teaspoon of ghee on it to start the smoking. Seal the bowl with a tight-fitting lid to keep the smoke inside. I’d say smoke it for at least 2 minutes. You can do it for longer if you like a stronger flavour. Transfer the marinade to a food-safe ziplock bag and drop it into a sous vide bath set to 67oC for about 90 minutes. If you don’t have a sous vide device, or a water bath, no worries. Here’s the perfectly serviceable jugaad: Take the largest stock pot you have and fill it with water, up to three-fourths of its depth. Let it simmer and then turn the heat down to sim. Now insert a temperature probe and wait for the water to reach 70oC. At this point, lower your ziplock bag into it in such a way that all the chicken is under the water. Secure the bag against the wall of the vessel with a metal clip. Stir the water once in a while and keep a watch on the temperature. If it goes below 65oC, use the lowest heat setting to get it back up to 70oC. Do this for 90 minutes. Yes, it sounds painful, but this is what you need to do to get the most succulent chicken breast possible. If you really like the output, you can always buy a cheap sous vide device online. Take the cooked chicken out and grill it in a pan with some oil, at a high temperature, till it browns beautifully. You can now serve it as a dry dish, after sprinkling some chaat masala on it for the mild, pungent hit of the hydrogen sulphide and a little lime juice for the acid hit. Or, you can drop it into a makhani gravy (Chapter 7) to turn it into chicken tikka makhani.

Good recipes that use simple ingredients are a decent way to get started on your journey to becoming a good cook. In general, recipes are limiting from a culinary education standpoint because it’s like trying to learn a craft by only looking at the output, with no knowledge of why what you do has the effect it does.

As far as onions go, they can be: Cubed (for mild flavour, best added later in the dish) Half-moon sliced (for mild flavour) Minced (for medium flavour) Pureed (for high flavour. Add this earlier in the dish and cook it for longer)

Some handy tips: If you want to reduce the lachrymatory torture because of the syn-propanethial-S-oxide generated each time you mechanically damage an onion, cut it right under a ceiling fan, or use a small USB fan to blow away the irritant. However, the fan will simply blow it all over, leaving the other occupants of your house with some mild to moderate eye irritation. Depending on the general political philosophy at play in the household, this might be acceptable as an instance of ‘let’s share both the pain and joy’ socialism, or unacceptable from the standpoint of ‘You suffer the pain, keep me out of it, but give me the finished product to enjoy’ exploitative capitalism. You could also chop onions under water and avoid this political dilemma altogether. In most situations, you can replace shallots with onions. Shallots have a sweeter flavour profile that works perfectly with hot and spicy south Indian dishes, so if you can get them, nothing like it. Please ask misbehaving adult children to peel shallots as penance.

When it comes to tomatoes, here are your options: Chopped (for gravy dishes with a bit more texture or for drier dishes). Pureed (for smooth gravy dishes). To take things to the next level, add concentrated tomato paste. If you don’t have tomato paste, use a sachet of ketchup. In dishes where the tomato is the star of the show, consider adding some dehydrated tomato powder too.

Some handy tips: Recipes that call for removing the seeds and pulp should be burnt at the stake. That’s where all the flavour is. Of course, there might be some situations that call for removing the skin, although you can always puree and run it through a sieve to remove the fibrous bits. The outcome will largely be the same.

Vegetables can be: Peeled if they have a thick, inedible skin. In general, we tend to discard more skin than necessary, and almost all vegetables have a ton of flavour just beneath the skin. You can use a general rule of thumb that vegetable or fruit flavour is a gradient that goes down as you travel from just under the skin to the core. Cut: a) Chopped to the size you want in your dish. b) Minced, if it is going to be cooked for a short time. Remember, the more the surface area, the faster it will cook. Once you have done that, you can also: Use the chopped vegetables as is. Blanch: This is best for green leafy vegetables. You can also puree them, say, for palak dishes. Steam: Generally better than boiling vegetables. Sauté in fat: To brown them and add more flavour, thanks to the Maillard reaction. Bake: Coat them with oil and put them in an oven at 180oC till they are evenly browned. This is more time consuming but requires less fat. If you have an air fryer, you can do this faster than in a conventional oven. Deep-fry: Reserve this for special occasions and obsessive attempts to ‘get that restaurant flavour’. When you order a bhindi masala in a restaurant, the bhindi is chopped and deep-fried before being added to the gravy. That is why it tastes so good.

Some handy tips: Don’t waste your time marinating vegetables. They usually don’t have enough protein for the acid to tenderize, and they absorb salt pretty quickly in a dish anyway. It’s a good habit to store chopped vegetables in a bowl of water. While some vegetables do not oxidise quickly, many do. Research on habit-forming tells us that it’s always better to apply a rule to everything so that the habit is easy to institutionalize. If you are chopping vegetables well ahead of the cooking time, squeeze some lime juice into the water. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an excellent antioxidant. Don’t throw away peels. Collect them and store them in the fridge to make vegetable stock. Once you are done using them for stock, you can compost them. Be careful with green/leafy/delicate vegetables. Tearing the leaves by hand will cause damage in between cell walls and help retain crunchiness and structure. Using a knife will likely slice through cells and activate enzymatic defence mechanisms that cause them to wilt and brown.

Prepping meat is about deciding whether to use it as is, or to marinate it, or to brine and then marinate it. Just marination does very little, so my recommendation is to always brine as a bare minimum. Also, don’t marinate for over an hour. Brining is what results in juicy, flavourful meat. You can always add flavour during the cooking process.

Most lentils take longer to cook in an acidic gravy, which almost all gravies tend to be, so it’s better to cook them separately. Pressure-cooking is the most convenient way to prep lentils. You can refer to the table in Chapter 1 for soak and pressure-cook times. Use a pinch of baking soda for harder/bigger legumes to reduce cook time. Avoid adding salt before pressure-cooking to reduce cook times. You can cook smaller lentils in the microwave after soaking them. Add some fat when pressure-cooking lentils to prevent foaming.

Once washed, you can either choose to soak it or use as is. A general tip is to soak the long grain varieties, used in pulao and biryani, for 20–30 minutes, so that a good amount of water absorption happens before the cooking process. This will result in a more evenly cooked final product

For making regular steamed rice, no soaking is required. However, in my experience, unless you are using a pressure cooker (which is perfectly fine given the convenience), go ahead and soak all varieties. This will reduce the cook time and minimize chances of the rice sticking to the bottom of the pot and getting scorched.

Boiled eggs: Bring water to a boil, drop the eggs into it, turn the heat off and close the lid. It takes 8 minutes for medium-boiled and 12 minutes for hard-boiled eggs to be ready. Adding a pinch of baking soda will reduce the chances of the egg sticking to its shell. Scrambled eggs: Break the eggs and salt them for 15 minutes before cooking. Then, at low heat, cook the eggs in butter. Stir constantly. You can also add some cream or milk for fluffiness. Poached eggs: Bring water to around 95oC, just short of a full boil. Strain the egg of any loose egg white and drop it into the water for 5 minutes, till the white sets. Omelette: Break the egg and salt it for 15 minutes before making an omelette. Add cubes of frozen butter when the omelette is cooking for a creamier texture.

Here is the algorithm for plain steamed rice: In a vessel, add prepped (washed and soaked for 20–30 minutes) rice, and water that is one knuckle of your index finger above the level of the rice. Bring it to a boil. Salt is optional. Keep in mind that a 1–1.5 per cent of salt by weight of final cooked rice is a good place to start. So, if you are a beginner cook breaking into a sweat about how much salt to add, weigh the water and rice, and add 1 per cent of salt. If that’s not enough, add more the next time. Once the starches gelatinize and the water level reaches the top of the rice, reduce heat to low and close the lid. Wait for 10–15 minutes. Using a fork, gently check to see if there is any water at the bottom of the vessel. Do not fluff up the rice now, just do this surreptitiously in one corner. If there is water left, close the lid and wait for another minute before checking again. Do this till there is no water left at the bottom. Turn the heat off, keep the lid closed and let the rice sit for 10 minutes. This is crucial as it is at this point that the gelatinized amylose and amylopectin strike some backroom political deals and align to ensure that your grains are separate and fluffy. Use a fork (never a spoon!) to fluff up the rice before serving.

If you are cooking a very small amount of rice, just for yourself (and maybe one other person), microwave oven is an option too. Just 10 minutes at high and 10–15 minutes at low will get you perfectly serviceable steamed rice. Don’t use this method for large amounts of rice though, as your microwave’s dead spots will leave you with an unacceptable amount of uncooked rice.

Once you master this, you can start experimenting with flavours. Use 50 per cent coconut milk + 50 per cent water. Use soy sauce instead of salt for umami-flavoured rice. Add flavouring to the water: Onion powder, garlic powder, lime zest (but never lime juice). Use vegetable, meat or seafood stock to add more depth of flavour.

Rice + Lentils Typically, the texture of the rice in such a dish needs to be soft and well-mixed with the lentils. A pressure cooker is the most efficient way to do this. Here’s how you can go about it: Heat fat and whole spices. Add prepped rice, lentils, stock (or water) and salt. With such a dish, you can be generous with the water because you want a mushy consistency. Pressure cook for at least 15 minutes. Once depressurized, open and add the finishing flavouring, tempering and herbs. Finishing flavouring could very well be a separate gravy, like in the case of bisi bele bhath.

The algorithm for pulao is a fusion of the algorithms for flavoured rice and regular steamed rice. You might want to consider using a long-grain variety of rice, which has less amylopectin and whose grains stick less to each other. Heat fat and add whole spices like cumin. Add your choice of prepped vegetables. Use finely chopped vegetables so that they cook at the same time as the rice, while maintaining some texture and mouthfeel. Add your choice of brined and marinated meat. Add the washed and soaked rice. Let it cook a little with the other ingredients. Add water, or any kind of stock, till it’s about one knuckle on your index finger above the level of the rice. Bring to a boil and follow the same instructions as the ones for plain steamed rice (Step 2 onwards). Once the water has reached the level of the rice, you can optionally add finishing spices such as saffron in milk, roasted dry fruits, garam masala, etc., before closing the lid and letting the rice absorb the rest of the water. At the time of fluffing, you can garnish with herbs.

What atta is perfectly designed for is to make rotis and parathas that are soft and flaky, as opposed to being chewy. Anyone who has tried to make chapattis with maida will attest to this fact. Maida has better gluten-forming capabilities, which is why it’s preferred for making unleavened breads like naan, kulcha, or baking cakes and breads. It doesn’t work for chapattis because when you add water to maida, it forms a stretchy, strong gluten structure that we do not want in a chapatti or paratha.

So, let’s get going with the algorithm for an unleavened wheat-based bread dough. Take atta and water in a 1:1 by weight ratio and roughly mix them together. Let this sit for 30 minutes. Thanks to a process called autolysis, the wheat will mix with water and form gluten structures by itself, with no kneading required. This is a 100 per cent hydration dough. Depending on the brand of the atta, the room temperature and the alignment of Beta Centauri, this can either become a sticky dough that is hard to handle, or a slightly hard dough that will result in papad, not chapatti. If you are a beginner, you might want to start with less water and work your way up once you get used to managing a moderately wet dough. More water results in a softer final product. Now, gently work salt into the dough till it’s evenly distributed. As a general rule, you can use 1% salt by weight of the dough as a rough guide. Use more if it’s not seasoned well enough for your taste. Salt is not added during the autolysis phase since it tends to tighten gluten, and we do not want that till the dough forms an extensible structure that gives us a perfectly soft, yet structurally sound, chapatti. If you want an even softer chapatti, you can use boiling water. Personally, I prefer my chapattis to offer a modicum of resistance to my teeth and not melt in the mouth. So, experiment with both these variables—the temperature and amount of water—till you get the kind of dough you like.

The general way to do this with yeast is: Take maida and water in a 1:0.7 ratio. You can substitute up to 50 per cent of the maida with atta if you want a more whole-wheaty flavour. If you do this, remember to add a little more water because atta is a thirstier flour. Let it sit for 30 minutes to autolyse. Work salt into the dough and then add half a teaspoon of instant yeast. The more you add, the faster the fermentation will be. Cover the dough with a wet cloth and let it rise till it doubles in size. Depending on where you live and what time of the year it is, this might take anywhere from 30 minutes (in Chennai) to 2–3 hours (in Srinagar). Place it inside a switched-off oven to accelerate the process. If you want to take your naans and kulchas to the next level, place the kneaded dough in the refrigerator to let it rise more slowly over a longer period of time. Longer fermentation always results in richer and more complex flavoured bread. Do not forget to cover the vessel or else the dough will dry out in the fridge. If you are fermenting overnight, or for twenty-four hours, all you need is flour, water, salt and yeast. If you are using a more rapid room temperature rise, adding some enriching ingredients like milk, eggs, fat or sugar will improve the flavour and texture of the final product.

If you are not someone who bakes cakes regularly, don’t buy baking powder because it has a shorter shelf life than baking soda. Follow the same instructions and replace yeast with baking soda. You will need to add yoghurt to the dough as well in step 2. Adjust the amount of water suitably since yoghurt is also mostly water. Finally, don’t let it rest for more than 30–45 minutes because chemical leaveners can be fast and do not depend as much on room temperature.

General Dough Tips If you are planning to deep-fry (like a puri or kachori), the dough needs to have much less water, so add more fat instead. Fat shortens gluten strands, which is what you need in a puri that needs to be flaky without being chewy. Use as little of dusting flour as possible (for puris, don’t use any). Use oil instead. The dusting flour will burn in the 170oC oil and turn into not-very-nice-to-eat compounds.

French cooking was among the first cuisines to adapt to the Industrial Age. It was not only the first to document standardized methods and recipes for dishes, but it also went a step ahead and documented the preparation of building blocks for dishes that could be made in bulk, and then actual dishes could be assembled in very little time.

more flavour-heavy dal, for which the method might look more like this: Heat fat and add whole spices. Cook onions till they brown (remember the Maillard reaction from Chapter 3). Add ginger, garlic and tomatoes. Let them reduce and thicken. Reduce heat and add spice powders, such as coriander and cumin powder. Remember, spice powders are sensitive to high heat. Add pressure-cooked lentils. Add more water to achieve the desired level of consistency. Add salt and finishing spices, such as garam masala. Turn off the heat, temper with whole spices like mustard and cumin. Garnish with herbs and squeeze some lime juice (recall the balancing with acid concept from Chapter 4).

In the nineteenth century, Marie-Antoine Carême (the last name is pronounced best while attempting to dislodge some phlegm in your throat) anointed these five sauces as the building blocks for all of French cuisine in his monumental work L’Art de la Cuisine Française au Dix-Neuvième Siecle: Béchamel: A white sauce made from butter, flour and dairy. Velouté: A white sauce made from butter, flour and white stock (poultry, sea food or vegetable). Espagnole: A brown sauce made from butter, flour and brown stock (red meat). Tomato: A red sauce made from butter, flour and tomatoes. Hollandaise (added later): A sauce made using egg yolks, clarified butter and acid.

Let’s start with what makes a gravy evoke a specific flavour from a region, cultural label or cooking style? These are just broad-brush generalizations, by the way. Gujarati: Use of gram flour, yoghurt, sesame seeds, sugar and lime juice. Punjabi: Use of ginger, garlic, onion and tomato-based gravies with coriander and cumin powder. Chettinadu: Use of shallots, garlic, curry leaves, red chillies and fennel (saunf). Malabar: Use of shallots, garlic, curry leaves and coconut milk. Mughlai: Use of cashew nut paste, or cream, and garam masala (mace, nutmeg, cardamom). Bhuna: Use of browned onions and slow cooking to thicken a gravy till it coats the main ingredient. Banarsi: Use of spices mixed in yoghurt. Jain: Use of turmeric, asafoetida, coriander, jeera and chilli powder (no onion or garlic). Bengali: Use of mustard oil and panch phoran spice mix.

Base Gravy Tips In general, avoid adding salt or sugar to your base gravies. You can add them when you make the dish and have better control over the final flavour profile. Always strain the gravy after blending to get rid of all the fibrous husks. They won’t have any flavour left after an hour of cooking. We aren’t looking to maximize the Maillard browning reaction in a base gravy because we will do that when we make the dish.

Indian gravy algorithm, combining all the things we have learned so far. Begin by asking yourself these questions: What kind of gravy do you want to cook? Vegetables/meat/legumes/egg/seafood? What style do you want to cook it in? Punjabi/Bengali/ Chettinaadu/Maharashtra, etc.? Prep ingredients (check the section on prepping of ingredients in this chapter): Main ingredients, base spice mixes, finishing spice mixes, base whole spices, tempering whole spices, garnish, fat of choice, acid(s) of choice, base gravy of choice, flavoured oils of choice. Heat your choice of fat and add base whole spices. If your dish involves onions, cook them as appropriate (translucent, light brown, dark brown). If your dish involves ginger or garlic, lower the heat and cook them. Optionally, add a splash of alcohol to deglaze the pan and extract more flavour from the spices. If your dish involves tomatoes, add them. You can also add some ketchup, or tomato paste, and let it reduce. Add the base gravy of your choice and let it cook briefly (it’s already cooked, so don’t cook it for too long). Add the main prepped ingredients. Lower the heat and add the base spice mix. Add the acids (tamarind or vinegar). Add stock (water/stock/coconut milk/yoghurt) with starch. Add sugar and salt, and taste to check for balance. Bring it to a boil. Switch off heat. Optionally, add finishing spice mix. Adjust for thickness and flavour intensity by adding butter/cream/thickeners. Optionally, add a finishing acid like citrus juice. You can also add umami ingredients like MSG, mushroom powder. Temper using regional, dish-appropriate spices and choice of fat. Add a garnish of your choice. Optionally, add a flavouring oil of your choice.

The gravy cheat sheet: A good gravy is about striking the right balance of flavours in each layer. If you turn the dial to 11 and use a base gravy, fresh spices, finishing spices and a flavouring oil, your dish will be unpalatably over-spiced. I’d say use finishing spices very sparingly and pay close attention to whether you want to use garlic as a paste or roughly chopped. Consider using finishing oils only in lightly spiced dishes. In general, use whole spices early in the cooking process and spice powders later. However, it is not uncommon to add turmeric and chilli powder early in the process because they are primarily used for colour and heat, not flavour. Remember the rules of flavour and always create a three-way balance between salt, sweet and sour to create a memorable dish. These three will elevate the flavours of the spices you add. If you need to thicken your gravy, add starch-based flours like rice, corn or wheat flours, but remember that these will mute the intensity of flavours in your dish. Consider using xanthan or guar gum, as these modernist thickeners work tremendously well in small quantities and do not add any flavour of their own. If your gravy is too intense, you can add fat (ghee, butter, cream or coconut milk) to balance it. If your dish feels too heavy and fatty, you can add an acid to reduce the perception of greasiness.

A chutney involves eight elements: Cooked ingredients: Essentially, these are things that don’t taste good raw. It could be beetroot, eggplant, or cabbage for that matter. Pick one of your choice. Raw ingredients: Things that taste good raw, such as carrot or radish, and most fruits. Again, pick one. Nutty ingredients: Like roasted lentils, cashews, coconut, etc. These add body and crunch to the chutney. Pick one or two from these. Herbs: The green things, like mint and coriander. Pick one or both. Seasoning: Basically salt and sugar for balance. Black salt can also add a lovely flavour dimension. You can also use honey instead of sugar. If you are using fruits, you don’t need any additional sugar because the fruits will bring fructose to the party. Heat: Use pepper, ginger, or red and green chillies. Pick just one or two from this list. Acid: You can use anything from vinegar to citrus juice to amchoor to yoghurt (which makes it a raita) and tamarind juice. Pick one or two from among these. Tempering: This is optional, and as per regional or dish-specific preferences.

Chutney and Raita Rules Don’t pick too many ingredients or your chutney will taste like nothing in particular. Use flavour-pairing rules for ingredients and combine ones that go well together, like basil and mango. Roast nuts or lentils before using them. If you are making a green chutney that predominantly features leaves (coriander, mint, etc.) don’t add the acid till just before serving. Strong acids quickly decolourize leaves and turn them into a dull olive green that looks unappetizing. Yoghurt, however, is not a very strong acid, so it’s okay to mix greenish raitas ahead of time. Season raw vegetables with salt ahead of time. Let it extract the extra water out of them to make them crisp and taste better. Do not do this for leaves, as the salt will make them wilt and lose crunch. If you are planning to use raw onions or radishes, consider pickling them in vinegar ahead of time to tame their sharpness. You could also blanch them if you don’t want the strong vinegary taste.

There are seven elements that go into a balanced salad. Of course, this is just a guideline. Feel free to ignore any elements. Greens Carbs: Optional if you are the type who eats a salad only because it’s ‘healthy’. Vegetables: These can be cooked, pickled or raw. Anyone who thinks raw radish is a good idea must be shredded and thrown into a tub of mayonnaise. Always season raw vegetables with salt because they taste terrible otherwise. Salted tomatoes and cucumbers taste amazing in a salad. Fruits: These could be fresh or sun-dried. Proteins: These could include legumes, paneer (or any other kind of cheese), tofu, eggs, shredded chicken, cured meats, etc. Crunch: Since a salad does not have an intense flavour profile, it needs to have variation in texture and mouthfeel. Adding nuts, roasted papad or fried onions will make a salad taste and feel interesting. Fancy ingredients: Olives, cheese, etc.

The Biryani Rice Algorithm Wash the rice thoroughly. We want to evict every surface molecule of sticky amylopectin, which is the enemy of good biryani. Do this four or five times, till the water runs clear. Soak the rice for 20 minutes. Then wash and drain again. Soaking the rice will help it cook more evenly. Take a vessel and add lots of water. Since we will partially cook the rice, after fully submerging it, we don’t have worry about the amount of water as long as it is more than three to four times the volume of rice. To this water, it is absolutely critical that you add salt. This is how the rice will get seasoned. If you don’t season it well, the biryani will taste flat. Remember, because we are using extra water, not all the salt will get into the rice, so add a little more to compensate for this. A general rule of thumb is to add salt till the water tastes like the sea. If you have never tasted sea water, please travel to a seaside city like Chennai. A good biryani is worth this effort. You can also add whole spices to the rice if you want to add another layer of flavour, but remember that spices aren’t water-soluble and not much is going to stick to the rice. A teaspoon of ghee will help here. If you want a more intense flavour, and this is purely a personal preference, cook the rice in meat, seafood or vegetable stock. Bring the water to a boil. Once the rice reaches its full length but is still raw inside, turn off the heat and drain the rice into an open plate. Let it cool down. When straining the rice, please remove any whole spice husks. While restaurants want to give you visual confirmation of the fact that they are being generous with expensive spices by leaving those flavourless husks behind, you be a nice person and remove them. No one wants to be navigating through a minefield of cardamom husks when focusing on a mouthful of orgasmic biryani. If you are up for it, take a piece of thin cloth and make a small sachet of spices (a bouquet garni, if you will) that you want to use. Drop this into the water. That way, you won’t have to painstakingly fish the spice husks out later.

The aim of marination is to get the flavours to stick to the surface of the meat, but that alone does not help the meat to stay tender. The key to that is brining. A quick recap: Salt dehydrates vegetables but helps animal tissue retain moisture. This is why we drink water with salt and sugar when we are dehydrated. The salt helps you retain the water you just drank and not lose it to perspiration.

Here’s how you can go about it: Heat a litre of water (or more, if you are making a large quantity) and add salt (8 per cent of the amount of water) so that it fully dissolves. Let it cool down to room temperature. You can add other flavouring agents too, like ginger-garlic paste, spice powders, etc. Brining will cause salt and the other flavours in the solution to get pulled into the meat. Now immerse the meat pieces into the solution, ensuring that no part is exposed to air. This is crucial to prevent bacterial infections. Remember, meat needs to be frozen for storage, and we are keeping this in the regular section of the refrigerator, which is simply not cold enough to deter meat-loving bacteria. Based on the table on Page 184, calculate the duration for which you need to let it brine. Wash the meat in regular water post brining to get rid of the salty water on the surface.

The general rules for a good marinade are: Acids: Use at least two acids, one weak and one strong. Yoghurt and lime juice are the traditional choices. Dry spices: Use spice powders made from whole spices, which have been roasted and freshly ground. It’s best to make your own biryani masala using the lessons from Chapter 2. Fresh spices: Use fresh pasted ginger and garlic. The store-bought ones taste terrible thanks to the sodium citrate. Fat: This is crucial. Fat is what helps all the flavour stick to the meat. For the most part, there is enough fat in the yoghurt, but it won’t hurt to add a little ghee or oil. If you want a more intensely spiced biryani, you can heat the fat and add it your marinade before adding the yoghurt, so that the spices are cooked and their flavour molecules get dissolved in the acid. If you are using vegetables or paneer, add a little bit of gram flour as a binder, so that the marinade sticks.

The typical additional ingredients used are: Fried onions (birista): It is entirely worth frying your own onions. Store-bought ones go rancid in no time. But frying onions takes time and patience. They will seem to take ages to turn light brown, and then all of a sudden, like Usain Bolt at the 70 m line, summon all reserves of browning agility unbeknownst to novice cooks and turn into elemental carbon. Also remember that the onions will continue to crisp after you take them out of the frying pan. Coriander and mint leaves. Masala milk: This is typically a mix of super-delicate spices and flavouring ingredients, such as saffron, rose water and attar, added to mildly warm milk.

A neat little trick I’ve seen on an excellent YouTube channel—BongEats—is to layer bay leaves at the bottom of the vessel. This not only keeps the meat from burning, but also adds flavour to the biryani. Layer the meat pieces on top if this and then add the rice. Next you pour in the yakhni. Then goes in a layer of herbs, fried onions and masala milk, followed by another layer of rice and a final layer of herbs, masala milk and fried onions. Now, seal the vessel as well as you can to prevent loss of moisture. Let it cook at low heat for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat after that and let it sit for 15 more minutes. If you recall the tips from the previous chapter, what we are doing is letting the par-cooked rice go through a process called retrogradation, where the starches realign themselves to ensure each grain stands out separately.

So, let’s recap the biryani project plan, with all the science lessons outlined so far. The Rice Track Wash and soak rice for 20 minutes. Washing removes surface amylopectin and other chemicals, such as talc, which are used in the polishing process. Also, soaked rice cooks faster and more evenly. Par-cook the rice in excess water and salt, till it has grown to its full size, while being raw at the centre. Drain the rice and let it cool down in an open vessel. Cooling is a function of surface area. The more the surface area, the faster the cooling down will be. Also, the chances of some of the hotter grains continuing to cook all the way through will lessen. The Biryani Masala Track Dry-roast whole spices such as cardamom, cloves and mace. Heating activates the release of the volatile aroma molecules that make up the flavour of the spice. Grind them to a powder. Chapter 2 has a suggestion for a well-balanced biryani masala, but feel free to invent your own using the principles outlined there. You can, if you are not up to making your own spice mix, get sachets of biryani masala that you can use in one go. You can use the masala when cooking the meat/vegetable layer, and additionally sprinkle it during the layering and dum-cooking process, to add a more intense flavour to your biryani. The Protein Track Use bone-in cuts of meat with some skin on, particularly in case of poultry. Boneless cuts will become dry and rubbery. Brine the meat in an 8 per cent salt solution for the duration based on the brining table. Brining has two advantages: It gets salt into the meat, which makes it tastier, and, in turn, the salt prevents moisture loss from the muscle tissue during the cooking process, which results in moist and tender meat in the biryani. Wash the brine off and marinate the meat in a combination of yoghurt, biryani masala, ginger–garlic paste and any other spice that you fancy. Add some ghee and lime juice, and let it sit for at least an hour. Go easy on the salt in the marinade because you have already brined your meat. Cook the marinated meat at low heat. Remember that any temperature above 65°C will make the meat tough and rubbery. The idea is to turn some of the collagen in the connective tissues into gelatin, which will ensure the meat stays tender without overcooking the tissues. This process will result in a delicious, melt-in-the-mouth flavour that is the hallmark of a great biryani. This process will also yield yakhni, a rich, flavourful broth of rendered animal fat. Drain it out and store it because this will give the biryani its unctuous mouthfeel. The Onion Track Chop onions into small pieces. You will need more onions than you think because deep-fried onions shrink. If you tear up, use a small hand fan to blow away the irritant molecules. Heat oil up to 177oC and drop the onions into it. Don’t drop all of them in one go. That will cause the temperature of the oil to drop precipitously and make your onions greasy. Fry the onions in batches till they are just short of dark brown. The Masala Milk Track Warm milk at the lowest setting in the microwave for 10 seconds. To this, add strands of saffron, kewra water and attar (optional). The Herbs and Other Accoutrements Track Chop and keep ready other add-ins like coriander and mint leaves, etc. The Dum Track In a thick-bottomed vessel, use bay leaves as the base. Layer 1: Meat pieces. Layer 2: Half the rice. Layer 3: Half the masala milk, herbs and fried onion. Layer 4: Rest of the rice. Layer 5: Rest of the masala milk, herbs and fried onion. Seal the lid and use one of the many tricks you are familiar with by now to prevent moisture loss (using dough to seal the edges, or aluminium foil between the lid and vessel). At low heat, let it cook for 30 minutes. Switch off the heat after that and let it sit for 15 more minutes. Remember that the rice and meat are already 80 per cent cooked before this stage, so keep the heat as low as you can to prevent any scorching at the bottom. If you smell any burning, turn the heat even lower but wait out the 30+15 minutes. If you are using a heavy bottomed vessel and the lowest heat setting on your stove, it should not burn. Serve to a loved one.

Once you’ve mastered the art of layering biryani, you can experiment a little more. Rice layer: Cook the rice in diluted coconut milk for a fantastically rich flavour. This will work well with a Malabar-style spice mix. You can also experiment with other regional varieties of rice. While some of them are high in amylopectin, the technique used to cook basmati/long-grain rice can be used on most other varieties too. Spice mixes: It’s the combination of spices that makes a region’s biryani stand out. So, garam masala + saffron + fried onions + mint will give you Hyderabadi-style biryani. Try other combinations as well. For e.g., make a Mexican spice mix using chipotle sauce, cumin powder, garlic and onion powder, and use that for marinating meat. Protein layer: Try different styles of marination using spice combinations from Chapter 2, including experimenting with global cuisines. Herbs layer: Experiment with herbs that combine well and go with your choice of flavours. If you are trying out a Thai-style biriyani, you can use Thai basil and coriander, along with a spice mix that has lemongrass, ginger, shallots, garlic and fish sauce as marinade, and fried shallots for the crunch. When you think of biryani as a canvas, with a template that involves a rice layer, protein layer, region-specific spices, herbs and crunch, the possibilities are endless.

This is a central point of this book—we don’t hate violence. We hate and fear the wrong kind of violence, violence in the wrong context. Because violence in the right context is different.

How are we supposed to make sense of all these factors in thinking about behavior? We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets into categories, into buckets of explanation.

A behavior has just occurred. Why did it happen? Your first category of explanation is going to be a neurobiological one. What went on in that person’s brain a second before the behavior happened? Now pull out to a slightly larger field of vision, your next category of explanation, a little earlier in time. What sight, sound, or smell in the previous seconds to minutes triggered the nervous system to produce that behavior? On to the next explanatory category. What hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual was to the sensory stimuli that trigger the nervous system to produce the behavior? And by now you’ve increased your field of vision to be thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and short-term endocrinology in trying to explain what happened.

This speaks to an important point that runs through the book. As noted, we distinguish between hot-blooded and cold-blooded violence. We understand the former more, can see mitigating factors in it—consider the grieving, raging man who kills the killer of his child. And conversely, affectless violence seems horrifying and incomprehensible; this is the sociopathic contract killer, the Hannibal Lecter who kills without his heart rate nudging up a beat.*6 It’s why cold-blooded killing is a damning descriptor.

As this book’s starting point, we know that different disciplines produce different answers—because of some hormone; because of evolution; because of childhood experiences or genes or culture—and as the book’s central premise, these are utterly intertwined answers, none standing alone. But on the most proximal level, in this chapter we ask: What happened one second before the behavior that caused it to occur? This puts us in the realm of neurobiology, of understanding the brain that commanded those muscles.

The nervous system is about contrasts, unambiguous extremes between having something and having nothing to say, maximizing signal-to-noise ratios. And this is demanding and expensive.

Part of what makes the nervous system so distinctive is how distinctive neurons are as cells. Cells are usually small, self-contained entities—consider little round red blood cells: Neurons, in contrast, are highly asymmetrical, elongated beasts, typically with processes sticking out all over the place:

What neurons do is talk to one another, cause one another to get excited. At one end of a neuron are its metaphorical ears, specialized processes that receive information from another neuron. At the other end are the processes that are the mouth, that communicate with the next neuron in line.

The ears, the inputs, are called dendrites. The output begins with a single long cable called an axon, which then ramifies into axonal endings—these axon terminals are the mouths (ignore the myelin sheath for the moment). Those axon terminals connect to the dendrites of the next neuron in line. Thus a neuron’s dendritic ears are informed that the neuron behind it is excited. The flow of information then sweeps from the dendrites to the cell body to the axon to the axon terminals, and is then passed to the next neuron.

What actually goes from the dendrites to the axon terminals? A wave of electrical excitation. Inside the neuron are various positively and negatively charged ions. Just outside the neuron’s membrane are other positively and negatively charged ions. When a neuron has gotten an exciting signal from the previous neuron at the end of one single dendritic fiber, channels in the membrane in that dendrite open, allowing various ions to flow in and others to flow out, and the net result is that the inside of the end of that dendrite becomes more positively charged. The charge spreads toward the axon terminal, where it is passed to the next neuron. That’s it for the chemistry.

Because neurons have to work like crazy, using various pumps in their membranes, to push some positively charged ions out and to keep some negatively charged ones in, all in order to generate that negative internal resting state.

In other words, if a single dendritic fibril is excited, that’s not enough to pass on the excitation down to the axonal end and on to the next neuron. How does a message ever get passed on?

That arborized array of bifurcating dendritic branches ends in lots of ends of fibrils (time to introduce the term commonly used: “ends in lots of dendritic spines”). And in order to get sufficient excitation to sweep from the dendritic end of the neuron to the axonal end, you have to have summation—the same spine must be stimulated repeatedly and/or, more commonly, a bunch of the spinal neurons must be stimulated at once. You can’t get a wave, rather than just a ripple, unless you throw in a lot of pebbles.

From an informational standpoint, a neuron has two different types of signaling systems. From the dendritic spines to the starts of the axon hillock, it’s an analogue signal, with gradations of signals that dissipate over space and time. And from the axon hillock to the axon terminals, it’s a digital system with all-or-none signaling that regenerates down the length of the axon.

In other words, any given neuron integrates the inputs from all the neurons projecting to it. And out of this comes a rule: the more neurons that neuron A projects to, by definition, the more neurons it can influence; however, the more neurons it projects to, the smaller its average influence will be at each of those target neurons. There’s a trade-off.

This doesn’t matter in the spinal cord, where one neuron typically sends all its projections to the next one in line. But in the brain one neuron will disperse its projections to scads of other ones and receive inputs from scads of other ones, with each neuron’s axon hillock determining whether the threshold is reached and an action potential generated. The brain is wired in networks of divergent and convergent signaling.

Neurons have some additional tricks, at the end of an action potential, to enhance the contrast between nothing to say/something to say even more, two means of ending the action potential really fast and dramatically: something called delayed rectification and another thing called the hyperpolarized refractory period. Another minor detail from that diagram above—a type of glial cell wraps around an axon, forming a layer of insulation called a myelin sheath; this “myelination” causes the action potential to shoot down the axon faster.

Late in the nineteenth century an alternative view emerged, namely that each neuron remains an independent unit, and that the axon terminals of one neuron don’t actually touch the dendritic spines of the next. Instead there’s a tiny gap between the two. This notion was called the “neuron doctrine.”

And then in 1873 it all got solved by the Italian neuroscientist Camillo Golgi, who invented a technique for staining brain tissue in a novel fashion. And the aforementioned Cajal used this “Golgi stain” to stain all the processes, all the branches and branchlets and twigs of the dendrites and axon terminals of single neurons. Crucially, the stain didn’t spread from one neuron to the next. There wasn’t a continuous, merged net of a single superneuron.

The neurotransmitter molecule has a distinctive shape (with each copy of the molecule having the same). The receptor has a binding pocket of a distinctive shape that is perfectly complementary to the shape of the neurotransmitter. And thus the neurotransmitter—cliché time—fits into the receptor like a key into a lock. No other molecule fits snugly into that receptor; the neurotransmitter molecule won’t fit snugly into any other type of receptor. Neurotransmitter binds to receptor, which triggers those channels to open, and the currents of ionic excitation begin in the dendritic spine. This

the neurotransmitters have to be cleaned up. This occurs in one of two ways. First, for the ecologically minded synapse, there are “reuptake pumps” in the membrane of the axon terminal. They take up the neurotransmitters and recycle them, putting them back into those secretory vesicles to be used again.

The second option is for the neurotransmitter to be degraded in the synapse by an enzyme, with the breakdown products flushed out to sea (i.e., the extracellular environment, and from there on to the cerebrospinal fluid, the bloodstream, and eventually the bladder).

Suppose you want to increase the amount of neurotransmitter signaling across a synapse. Let’s translate that into the excitation terms of the previous section—you want to increase excitability across the synapse, such that an action potential in the presynaptic neuron has more of an oomph in the postsynaptic neuron, which is to say it has an increased likelihood of causing an action potential in that second neuron. You could increase the amount of neurotransmitter released—the presynaptic neuron yells louder. Or you could increase the amount of receptor on the dendritic spine—the postsynaptic neuron is listening more acutely. But as another possibility, you could decrease the activity of the reuptake pump. As a result, less of the neurotransmitter is removed from the synapse. Thus it sticks around longer and binds to the receptors repeatedly, amplifying the signal. Or, as the conceptual equivalent, you could decrease the activity of the degradative enzyme; less neurotransmitter is broken down, so more sticks around longer in the synapse, having an enhanced effect.

They do the opposite—they “hyperpolarize” the dendritic spine, opening different types of channels that make the resting potential even more negative (e.g., shifting from –70 mV to –80 mV). In other words, there are such things as inhibitory neurotransmitters.

Here is where we invoke Dale’s Principle, named for Henry Dale, one of the grand pooh-bahs of the field, who in the 1930s proposed a rule whose veracity forms the very core of each neuroscientist’s sense of well-being: an action potential releases the same type of neurotransmitter from all of the axon terminals of a neuron. Therefore there will be a distinctive neurochemical profile to a particular neuron—“Oh, that neuron is a neurotransmitter A–type neuron. And what that also means is that the neurons that it talks to have neurotransmitter A receptors on their dendritic spines.”

What’s up with this? Neuron A releases the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which floats across that “axoaxonic” synapse and binds to receptors on that side of neuron B’s axon terminal. And such an inhibitory effect (i.e., making that –70 mV resting potential even more negative) snuffs out any action potential hurtling down that branch of the axon, keeps it from getting to the very end and releasing neurotransmitter; in the jargon of the field, neuron A is having a neuromodulatory effect on neuron B.

Neuron A fires off a series of action potentials. What better way to energetically communicate that it’s all over than to become majorly silent, thanks to the feedback loop? It’s a means of sharpening a signal over time.* And note that neuron A can “determine” how powerful that negative feedback signal will be by how many of the ten thousand axon terminals it shunts toward neuron C instead of B.

What is the significance of the fact that the silent state of a neuron is negatively charged, rather than a neutral 0 mV? It’s a way of sharpening a signal within a neuron. Feedback, feed-forward, and lateral inhibition? A way of sharpening a signal within a circuit.

Neuron A’s dendrites sit just below the surface of the skin, and the neuron has an action potential in response to a painful stimulus. Neuron A then stimulates neuron B, which projects up the spinal cord, letting you know that something painful just happened. But neuron A also stimulates neuron C, which inhibits B. This is one of our feed-forward inhibitory circuits. Result? Neuron B fires for a while and then is silenced, and you perceive this as a sharp pain—you’ve been poked with a needle.

Meanwhile, there’s neuron D, whose dendrites are in the same general area of the skin and respond to a different type of painful stimulus. As before, neuron D excites neuron B, and the message is sent up to the brain. But it also sends projections to neuron C, where it inhibits it. Result? When neuron D is activated by a pain signal, it inhibits the ability of neuron C to inhibit neuron B. And you perceive it as a throbbing, continuous pain, like a burn or abrasion. Importantly, this is reinforced further by the fact that action potentials travel down the axon of neuron D much slower than in neuron A (having to do with that myelin that I mentioned earlier—details aren’t important). So the pain in neuron A’s world is not only transient but also fast. Pain in the neuron D branch not only is long-lasting but also has a slower onset.

The fact that pain works this way has important clinical implications. For one thing, it has allowed scientists to design treatments for people with severe chronic pain syndromes (for example, someone with a severe back injury). Implanting a little electrode into the fast pain pathway and attaching it to a stimulator on the person’s hip enables the patient to buzz that pathway now and then to turn off the chronic pain; it works wonders in many cases.

Given that every brain region is getting projections from and sending projections to a zillion other places, it is rare that an individual brain region is “the center for” anything. Instead it’s all networks where, far more often, a particular region “plays a key role in,” “helps mediate,” or “influences” a behavior. The function of a particular brain region is embedded in the context of its connections.

Here’s an example involving my three favorite hormones: during stress, hypothalamic neurons secrete CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone), which stimulates pituitary cells to secrete ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Once in the general circulation, ACTH gets to the adrenal glands, where it stimulates secretion of steroid stress hormones called glucocorticoids (with the human version being cortisol, aka hydrocortisone). Other hormones (e.g., estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and thyroid hormone) are released from peripheral glands as the final step of their own “hypothalamic/pituitary/peripheral gland axis.”

Not all hormones are regulated in this brain/pituitary/peripheral gland manner. In some cases there’s a brain/pituitary two-step, where the pituitary hormone exerts effects throughout the body; growth hormone generally fits this pattern. In other systems the brain sends projections down the spine and to a particular gland, helping to regulate its hormone release; the pancreas and its secretion of insulin are an example (where circulating glucose levels are the main regulator). Then there are weirdo hormones secreted from unlikely places like the heart or gut, where the brain regulates secretion only indirectly.

Hormone/neurotransmitter similarities continue. Like neurotransmitter receptors, a hormone receptor’s “avidity” for its hormone can change. This means that the shape of the binding site changes a bit, so that the hormone now fits more or less snugly, thus increasing or decreasing the duration of the hormone’s effects. The number of receptors for a particular hormone in a cell can also change, altering the cell’s sensitivity to that hormone’s effects. The number of receptors in a target cell can be as important as the levels of the hormone itself, and there are endocrine diseases where normal levels of a hormone are secreted but, because of a mutation in the hormone’s receptor, no signal gets through. Hormone levels are akin to how loudly someone speaks. Receptor levels are akin to the acuity with which ears detect that voice.

Finally, receptors for a hormone typically occur in only a subset of cells and tissues in the body, meaning that only those are responsive to the hormone. For example, only tail cells contain receptors for thyroid hormone when tadpoles are turning into frogs.

Naturally, Nauta was right. In different circumstances the frontal cortex and limbic system stimulate or inhibit each other, collaborate and coordinate, or bicker and work at cross-purposes. It really is an honorary member of the limbic system. And the interactions between the frontal cortex and (other) limbic structures are at the core of much of this book.

The evolutionarily ancient central amygdala plays a key role in innate fears. Surrounding it is the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is more recently evolved and somewhat resembles the fancy, modern cortex. It’s the BLA that learns fear and then sends the news to the central amygdala.

How does “fear extinction” occur? How do we learn that this person wasn’t so scary after all, that different doesn’t necessarily equal frightening? Recall how a subset of BLA neurons respond to the tone only once conditioning has occurred. Another population does the opposite, responding to the tone once it’s no longer signaling shock (logically, the two populations of neurons inhibit each other). Where do these “Ohhh, the tone isn’t scary anymore” neurons get inputs from? The frontal cortex. When we stop fearing something, it isn’t because some amygdaloid neurons have lost their excitability. We don’t passively forget that something is scary. We actively learn that it isn’t anymore.

Studies like these clarify that the amygdala isn’t about the pleasure of experiencing pleasure. It’s about the uncertain, unsettled yearning for a potential pleasure, the anxiety and fear and anger that the reward may be smaller than anticipated, or may not even happen. It’s about how many of our pleasures and our pursuits of them contain a corrosive vein of disease.

This is mediated by projections from an ancient, core brain structure, the “periaqueductal gray” (PAG); stimulation of the PAG can evoke panic attacks, and it is enlarged in people with chronic panic attacks. Reflecting the amygdala’s roles in vigilance, uncertainty, anxiety, and fear, it’s unpredictable pain, rather than pain itself, that activates the amygdala.

The amygdala/hippocampus interface. Naturally, the amygdala talks to other limbic structures, including the hippocampus. As reviewed, typically the amygdala learns fear and the hippocampus learns detached, dispassionate facts. But at times of extreme fear, the amygdala pulls the hippocampus into a type of fear learning.29 Back to the rat undergoing fear conditioning. When it’s in cage A, a tone is followed by a shock. But in cage B, the tone isn’t. This produces context-dependent conditioning—the tone causes fearful freezing in cage A but not in cage B. The amygdala learns the stimulus cue—the tone—while the hippocampus learns about the contexts of cage A versus B. The coupled learning between amygdala and hippocampus is very focalized—we all remember the view of the plane hitting the second World Trade Center tower, but not whether there were clouds in the background. The hippocampus decides whether a factoid is worth filing away, depending on whether the amygdala has gotten worked up over it. Moreover, the coupling can rescale. Suppose someone robs you at gunpoint in an alley in a bad part of town. Afterward, depending on the circumstance, the gun can be the cue and the alley the context, or the alley is the cue and the bad part of town the context.

Logically, when the amygdala wants to mobilize a behavior—say, fleeing—it talks to the frontal cortex, seeking its executive approval. But if sufficiently aroused, the amygdala talks directly to subcortical, reflexive motor pathways. Again, there’s a trade-off—increased speed by bypassing the cortex, but decreased accuracy. Thus the input shortcut may prompt you to see the cell phone as a gun.

The dissociation between fear and aggression is evident in violent psychopaths, who are the antithesis of fearful—both physiologically and subjectively they are less reactive to pain; their amygdalae are relatively unresponsive to typical fear-evoking stimuli and are smaller than normal.34 This fits with the picture of psychopathic violence; it is not done in aroused reaction to provocation. Instead, it is purely instrumental, using others as a means to an end with emotionless, remorseless, reptilian indifference.

To quote George W. Bush, within the frontal cortex, it’s the PFC that is “the decider.” Most broadly, the PFC chooses between conflicting options—Coke or Pepsi; blurting out what you really think or restraining yourself; pulling the trigger or not. And often the conflict being resolved is between a decision heavily driven by cognition and one driven by emotions.

All this takes energy, and when it is working hard, the frontal cortex has an extremely high metabolic rate and rates of activation of genes related to energy production.44 Willpower is more than just a metaphor; self-control is a finite resource. Frontal neurons are expensive cells, and expensive cells are vulnerable cells. Consistent with that, the frontal cortex is atypically vulnerable to various neurological insults.

Pertinent to this is the concept of “cognitive load.” Make the frontal cortex work hard—a tough working-memory task, regulating social behavior, or making numerous decisions while shopping. Immediately afterward performance on a different frontally dependent task declines.45 Likewise during multitasking, where PFC neurons simultaneously participate in multiple activated circuits.

Across primate species, the bigger the size of the average social group, the larger the relative size of the frontal cortex. This is particularly so with “fission-fusion” species, where there are times when subgroups split up and function independently for a while before regrouping. Such a social structure is demanding, requiring the scaling of appropriate behavior to subgroup size and composition.

Reliability Everybody has an intuitive idea of what it means for something to be reliable or unreliable. For software, typical expectations include: The application performs the function that the user expected. It can tolerate the user making mistakes or using the software in unexpected ways. Its performance is good enough for the required use case, under the expected load and data volume. The system prevents any unauthorized access and abuse.

Note that a fault is not the same as a failure [2]. A fault is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec, whereas a failure is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user. It is impossible to reduce the probability of a fault to zero; therefore it is usually best to design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing failures.

Until recently, redundancy of hardware components was sufficient for most applications, since it makes total failure of a single machine fairly rare. As long as you can restore a backup onto a new machine fairly quickly, the downtime in case of failure is not catastrophic in most applications. Thus, multi-machine redundancy was only required by a small number of applications for which high availability was absolutely essential.

There is no quick solution to the problem of systematic faults in software. Lots of small things can help: carefully thinking about assumptions and interactions in the system; thorough testing; process isolation; allowing processes to crash and restart; measuring, monitoring, and analyzing system behavior in production. If a system is expected to provide some guarantee (for example, in a message queue, that the number of incoming messages equals the number of outgoing messages), it can constantly check itself while it is running and raise an alert if a discrepancy is found

Scalability is the term we use to describe a system’s ability to cope with increased load. Note, however, that it is not a one-dimensional label that we can attach to a system: it is meaningless to say “X is scalable” or “Y doesn’t scale.” Rather, discussing scalability means considering questions like “If the system grows in a particular way, what are our options for coping with the growth?” and “How can we add computing resources to handle the additional load?”

Load can be described with a few numbers which we call load parameters. The best choice of parameters depends on the architecture of your system: it may be requests per second to a web server, the ratio of reads to writes in a database, the number of simultaneously active users in a chat room, the hit rate on a cache, or something else.

Once you have described the load on your system, you can investigate what happens when the load increases. You can look at it in two ways: When you increase a load parameter and keep the system resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, etc.) unchanged, how is the performance of your system affected? When you increase a load parameter, how much do you need to increase the resources if you want to keep performance unchanged?

The request triggers these events in order during its handling: onRequest: The server receives an HTTP request and routes it to a valid endpoint. Now, the request is ready to be processed. preParsing happens before the evaluation of the request’s body payload. The preValidation hook runs before applying JSON Schema validation to the request’s parts. Schema validation is an essential step of every route because it protects you from a malicious request payload that aims to leak your system data or attack your server. Chapter 5 discusses this core aspect further and will show some harmful attacks. preHandler executes before the endpoint handler. preSerialization takes action before the response payload transformation to a String, a Buffer, or a Stream, in order to be sent to the client. onError is executed only if an error happens during the request lifecycle. onSend is the last chance to manipulate the response payload before sending it to the client. onResponse runs after the HTTP request has been served.

It’s common to see the average response time of a service reported. (Strictly speaking, the term “average” doesn’t refer to any particular formula, but in practice it is usually understood as the arithmetic mean: given n values, add up all the values, and divide by n.) However, the mean is not a very good metric if you want to know your “typical” response time, because it doesn’t tell you how many users actually experienced that delay. Usually it is better to use percentiles. If you take your list of response times and sort it from fastest to slowest, then the median is the halfway point:

Queueing delays often account for a large part of the response time at high percentiles. As a server can only process a small number of things in parallel (limited, for example, by its number of CPU cores), it only takes a small number of slow requests to hold up the processing of subsequent requests—an effect sometimes known as head-of-line blocking.

When generating load artificially in order to test the scalability of a system, the load-generating client needs to keep sending requests independently of the response time. If the client waits for the previous request to complete before sending the next one, that behavior has the effect of artificially keeping the queues shorter in the test than they would be in reality, which skews the measurements

Even if you make the calls in parallel, the end-user request still needs to wait for the slowest of the parallel calls to complete. It takes just one slow call to make the entire end-user request slow, as illustrated in Figure 1-5. Even if only a small percentage of backend calls are slow, the chance of getting a slow call increases if an end-user request requires multiple backend calls, and so a higher proportion of end-user requests end up being slow (an effect known as tail latency amplification

People often talk of a dichotomy between scaling up (vertical scaling, moving to a more powerful machine) and scaling out (horizontal scaling, distributing the load across multiple smaller machines). Distributing load across multiple machines is also known as a shared-nothing architecture. A system that can run on a single machine is often simpler, but high-end machines can become very expensive, so very intensive workloads often can’t avoid scaling out.

While distributing stateless services across multiple machines is fairly straightforward, taking stateful data systems from a single node to a distributed setup can introduce a lot of additional complexity. For this reason, common wisdom until recently was to keep your database on a single node (scale up) until scaling cost or high-availability requirements forced you to make it distributed.

Reliability means making systems work correctly, even when faults occur. Faults can be in hardware (typically random and uncorrelated), software (bugs are typically systematic and hard to deal with), and humans (who inevitably make mistakes from time to time). Fault-tolerance techniques can hide certain types of faults from the end user.

Scalability means having strategies for keeping performance good, even when load increases. In order to discuss scalability, we first need ways of describing load and performance quantitatively. We briefly looked at Twitter’s home timelines as an example of describing load, and response time percentiles as a way of measuring performance. In a scalable system, you can add processing capacity in order to remain reliable under high load.

Maintainability has many facets, but in essence it’s about making life better for the engineering and operations teams who need to work with the system. Good abstractions can help reduce complexity and make the system easier to modify and adapt for new use cases. Good operability means having good visibility into the system’s health, and having effective ways of managing it.

In a complex application there may be more intermediary levels, such as APIs built upon APIs, but the basic idea is still the same: each layer hides the complexity of the layers below it by providing a clean data model. These abstractions allow different groups of people—for example, the engineers at the database vendor and the application developers using their database—to work together effectively.

The roots of relational databases lie in business data processing, which was performed on mainframe computers in the 1960s and ’70s. The use cases appear mundane from today’s perspective: typically transaction processing (entering sales or banking transactions, airline reservations, stock-keeping in warehouses) and batch processing (customer invoicing, payroll, reporting).

Different applications have different requirements, and the best choice of technology for one use case may well be different from the best choice for another use case. It therefore seems likely that in the foreseeable future, relational databases will continue to be used alongside a broad variety of nonrelational datastores—an idea that is sometimes called polyglot persistence [3].

If you want to fetch a profile in the relational example, you need to either perform multiple queries (query each table by user_id) or perform a messy multi-way join between the users table and its subordinate tables. In the JSON representation, all the relevant information is in one place, and one query is sufficient.

Anything that is meaningful to humans may need to change sometime in the future—and if that information is duplicated, all the redundant copies need to be updated. That incurs write overheads, and risks inconsistencies (where some copies of the information are updated but others aren’t). Removing such duplication is the key idea behind normalization in databases.

If the database itself does not support joins, you have to emulate a join in application code by making multiple queries to the database. (In this case, the lists of regions and industries are probably small and slow-changing enough that the application can simply keep them in memory. But nevertheless, the work of making the join is shifted from the database to the application code.)

when it comes to representing many-to-one and many-to-many relationships, relational and document databases are not fundamentally different: in both cases, the related item is referenced by a unique identifier, which is called a foreign key in the relational model and a document reference in the document model [9]. That identifier is resolved at read time by using a join or follow-up queries.

The main arguments in favor of the document data model are schema flexibility, better performance due to locality, and that for some applications it is closer to the data structures used by the application. The relational model counters by providing better support for joins, and many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.

The document model has limitations: for example, you cannot refer directly to a nested item within a document, but instead you need to say something like “the second item in the list of positions for user 251” (much like an access path in the hierarchical model). However, as long as documents are not too deeply nested, that is not usually a problem.

However, if your application does use many-to-many relationships, the document model becomes less appealing. It’s possible to reduce the need for joins by denormalizing, but then the application code needs to do additional work to keep the denormalized data consistent. Joins can be emulated in application code by making multiple requests to the database, but that also moves complexity into the application and is usually slower than a join performed by specialized code inside the database. In such cases, using a document model can lead to significantly more complex application code and worse performance

The locality advantage only applies if you need large parts of the document at the same time. The database typically needs to load the entire document, even if you access only a small portion of it, which can be wasteful on large documents. On updates to a document, the entire document usually needs to be rewritten—only modifications that don’t change the encoded size of a document can easily be performed in place [19]. For these reasons, it is generally recommended that you keep documents fairly small and avoid writes that increase the size of a document

It seems that relational and document databases are becoming more similar over time, and that is a good thing: the data models complement each other.v If a database is able to handle document-like data and also perform relational queries on it, applications can use the combination of features that best fits their needs. A hybrid of the relational and document models is a good route for databases to take in the future.

In a declarative query language, like SQL or relational algebra, you just specify the pattern of the data you want—what conditions the results must meet, and how you want the data to be transformed (e.g., sorted, grouped, and aggregated)—but not how to achieve that goal. It is up to the database system’s query optimizer to decide which indexes and which join methods to use, and in which order to execute various parts of the query.

Imperative code is very hard to parallelize across multiple cores and multiple machines, because it specifies instructions that must be performed in a particular order. Declarative languages have a better chance of getting faster in parallel execution because they specify only the pattern of the results, not the algorithm that is used to determine the results.

Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices

“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”

“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”

There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the senses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself.

There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will. They move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm. For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of disobedience. When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.

It began at least seven times according to one historian, meaning by that that he could distinguish at least seven occasions on which particular mixes of human skills and natural facts came together to make possible a new order of life based on the exploitation of nature.

Civilization is the name we give to the interaction of human beings in a very creative way, when, as it were, a critical mass of cultural potential and a certain surplus of resources have been built up. In civilization this releases human capacities for development at quite a new level and in large measure the development which follows is self-sustaining.

Back in 27 BC the Roman general Marcus Agrippa built a big temple on the edge of Rome and, in a fit of indecision, decided to dedicate it to all the gods at once. Six hundred years later the building was still standing and the Pope decided to turn it into a Christian church dedicated to St Mary and the Martyrs. Fourteen hundred years after that it’s still standing and still has its original roof. Technically it’s now called the Church of Saint Mary, but the tourists still call it the Pantheon, or All the Gods.

But everywhere, sooner or later, he was stopped by men in white shirts with strict, smug expressions on their faces. And one couldn’t fight them. Not only did they have the state on their side, they were the state. The last complaint was rejected. The fighting was over because the white shirts had decided so. And Ove never forgave them that.

Sonja said once that to understand men like Ove and Rune, one had to understand from the very beginning that they were men caught in the wrong time. Men who only required a few simple things from life, she said. A roof over their heads, a quiet street, the right make of car, and a woman to be faithful to. A job where you had a proper function. A house where things broke at regular intervals, so you always had something to tinker with.

That is Ove’s train of thought.

“Loving someone is like moving into a house,” Sonja used to say. “At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren’t actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfection, but rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it’s cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home.”

Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it’s often one of the great motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis. Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.

Later still come the Mesoamericans. Once we are past about 1500 BC, though, only this last example is sufficiently isolated for interaction not to be a big part of explaining what happens.

The most satisfactory answer appears to be that civilization was likely always to result from the coming together of a number of factors predisposing a particular area to throw up something dense enough to be recognized later as civilization, but that different environments, different influences from outside, and different cultural inheritances from the past meant that men did not move in all parts of the world at the same pace or even towards the same goals.

None the less, early civilizations, like later ones, seem to have a common positive characteristic in that they change the human scale of things. They bring together the co-operative efforts of more men and women than in earlier societies and usually do this by physically bringing them together in larger agglomerations, too. Our word ‘civilization’ suggests, in its Latin roots, a connection with urbanization.

The time would come when each would have to think about marriage and children; but, for the moment, their passionate fondness each for the other was a source of delight and envy all around the kingdom.

Odysseus made to follow, but as he neared the gate himself, he heard a strange whining noise. On a pile of old bones, dung and litter, an ancient and emaciated dog lay panting, its grizzled fur ravaged by mange and ticks. It strained up towards Odysseus, flattened its ears and gave a feeble wag of the tail. It was all Odysseus could do not to cry out. He knew Argus at once. His favourite hound. He had last seen him, barely out of puppyhood, howling woefully on the quayside twenty years ago when his master departed for Troy. That had been Odysseus’s last image of home as his ship left harbour. Telemachus in his mother’s arms, Argus leaping and yowling, Penelope trying not to weep.

Trying to present the Odyssey as a story of a faithful, loving husband yearning for his beloved wife is all very well, but given his propensity to father children by women beginning with ‘C’ alone – Circe, Calypso and now Callidice (which perhaps ironically means ‘good judgement’) – we have to appraise Odysseus against standards of marital fidelity and monogamy rather different from our own.

Telegonus takes the body of Odysseus, along with Penelope and Telemachus, to his mother’s island and the place of his birth, Aeaea. They bury Odysseus.fn3 Circe makes them all immortal. Telegonus marries Penelope, and Telemachus marries Circe. Thus the mature women acquire fresh young sons of Odysseus to replace the original, and therefore, I suppose, they might be considered the winners.

The ultimate victory of Troy over Greece through the foundation of Rome by the Trojan Aeneas is repeatedly referred to by Virgil throughout his epic as a victory of Asia over the western Mediterranean. One of the epithets used for Aeneas is ‘descendant of Dardanus’ – from whom come the Dardanelles. The Trojan peninsula was then as now a gateway between continents. From the Trojan War through the schism that moved the Roman Empire to Byzantium, the Crusades, the wars between Europe and the Ottoman Empire – paused if not concluded by the Great War – the area has always been an ethnical and geographical flashpoint.

As an interesting sidebar, there grew up a legend, largely disseminated by the twelfth-century historian and cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth, that a descendant of Aeneas called Brutus went to a damp, foggy island somewhere north of France, defeated a race of giants there and settled his own realm, which was named, after a slight corruption of Brutus, ‘Britain’.

But that is perhaps the greatest of all Greek tricks – idealism, the imagining of perfect Platonic forms and paradigms that can be posited and, once posited, pursued. ‘Let us go back to the perfect age of the perfect Areopagus’ skips the unfortunate truth that there never was such an age nor such an institution.

The ancient Greeks had a word for the hero’s journey home, their voyage of peril, temptation, loss, yearning and epic adventure. The word was nostos. Thousands of years later, it was to be combined with the Greek for ‘longing’, ‘sorrow’ and ‘pain’, algia, to form the new word nostalgia, coined in 1688 by a Swiss academic to describe the acute homesickness suffered by Swiss mercenary soldiers pining – not quite for the fjords – but for the peaks and valleys of their native Alps. Slowly ‘nostalgia’ evolved to extend its meaning to a longing for a time as much as a place.
